This is the analysis repo for a pilot study on the use of ChatGPT for idea generation. We are investigating whether people's psychological approaches to AI tools (e.g., let the AI do the heavy lifting vs. stay in control of the tool) affects people's creative outcomes and perceptions of the creative process. Main research questions:
1. How do the originality and homogeneity of ideas generated by different groups of users compare? We test Passengers (who are told to let the AI do the heavy lifting), Pilots (told to stay in control of the tool), and a control group with no AI access.
2. What is the relationship between perceived creativity and actual creativity?
