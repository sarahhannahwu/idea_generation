	abstract = {Negative health events can cause considerable stress in patients, negatively impacting both physical health and psychological well-being. To cope, many patients turn to socially supportive interactions and social media has become an important tool for accessing social support networks. However, research on the mental and physical health outcomes of social media-enabled social support seeking has produced conflicting results. This inconsistency in research findings has made it difficult for practitioners to make recommendations to patients on how to access online social support following negative health events. In this short commentary, I argue that effective access to stress-buffering social support online is intimately tied up in features of the social media platforms through which that support is transmitted. I propose three theory-backed distinctions between social media platforms with the goal of directing users toward effective, helpful social media engagement following negative health events.},

	abstract = {Recent research on the addictive potential of modern technologies such as the internet, smartphones, or social networking sites ({SNSs}) has suggested that emotional and motivational changes associated with the sudden discontinuation of engagement with the technology mirror the aversive consequences seen when drug use is ceased abruptly. This has been observed even in moderate users and interpreted as a manifestation of withdrawal, an important marker of physical dependence in substance use disorders. On the other hand, a growing literature emphasises the positive effects of "digital detox" on mental health and well-being. Using a battery of affective and motivational measures, both explicit and implicit, the present study tracked the effects of a week of significantly reduced {SNS} use in moderate to heavy {SNS} users (N = 51). Our pre-registered analyses showed that the intervention elicited affective changes neither consistent with a general withdrawal syndrome (i.e., increased negative affect and cravings) nor with a general beneficial effect on well-being: While our data indicated some abstinence-related decreases of negative affect and boredom, they also showed a reduction of positive affect. These changes occurred regardless of problematic/addictive use behaviours. Importantly, restricting {SNS} use for one week had no effect on implicit measures of {SNS} use motivation (i.e., approach biases, time distortion and effort expenditure for {SNS} access) nor did it influence explicit cravings and {SNS} cue-reactivity. Together our findings suggest that restricting {SNS} use has nuanced and potentially offsetting effects on well-being. These could arise because use reduction may concurrently remove experiences that trigger negative emotions (e.g., upward social comparisons or Fear of Missing Out) but also those that elicit positive emotions (e.g., social approval). The hypothesised lack of a net effect on well-being would be consistent with our finding that voluntary reduction of {SNS} use does not mitigate or exacerbate {SNS}-related urges.},

This investigation explores whether social media abstinence leads to improved daily well-being over four weeks of time. Community and undergraduate participants (N = 130) were randomly assigned to five experimental conditions: no change in social media use, and one week, two weeks, three weeks, and four weeks abstinence from social media (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat). All participants completed a daily diary measuring loneliness, well-being, and quality of day. Results showed no main effect of social media abstinence. The duration of abstinence was not associated with change in outcomes and order of abstinence did not explain variance in outcomes. Results are consistent with trivial effects detected in large cross-sectional research, and call into question the causal relationship between social media and well-being on the daily level.},

This study tested the effect of abstaining from social media use on participants’ well-being, affect, perceived stress, and sense of perceived loneliness. Design and Methods: Randomized, controlled design. Sixty-eight participants were randomized to one of two conditions. Findings: Those who abstained from social media use, compared with those in the control group, evidenced a decline in life satisfaction, an increase in negative affect, and an increase in loneliness. Practice Implications: Excessive social media use poses deleterious consequences for users, but abstinence may not necessarily exact positive changes; this outcome is dependent on the functions for which social media are used.},

These distinctive qualities of games also make them ideal for studying the mind. By being intuitive, games provide a unique vantage point for understanding the inductive biases that support behaviour in more complex, ecological settings than traditional laboratory experiments. By being fun, games allow researchers to study new questions in cognition such as the meaning of ‘play’ and intrinsic motivation, while also supporting more extensive and diverse data collection by attracting many more participants. We describe the advantages and drawbacks of using games relative to standard laboratory-based experiments and lay out a set of recommendations on how to gain the most from using games to study cognition. We hope this Perspective will lead to a wider use of games as experimental paradigms, elevating the ecological validity, scale and robustness of research on the mind.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2401.12491},
	abstract = {In the field of natural language processing, the rapid development of large language model ({LLM}) has attracted more and more attention. {LLMs} have shown a high level of creativity in various tasks, but the methods for assessing such creativity are inadequate. The assessment of {LLM} creativity needs to consider differences from humans, requiring multi-dimensional measurement while balancing accuracy and efficiency. This paper aims to establish an efficient framework for assessing the level of creativity in {LLMs}. By adapting the modified Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, the research evaluates the creative performance of various {LLMs} across 7 tasks, emphasizing 4 criteria including Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. In this context, we develop a comprehensive dataset of 700 questions for testing and an {LLM}-based evaluation method. In addition, this study presents a novel analysis of {LLMs}' responses to diverse prompts and role-play situations. We found that the creativity of {LLMs} primarily falls short in originality, while excelling in elaboration. Besides, the use of prompts and the role-play settings of the model significantly influence creativity. Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that collaboration among multiple {LLMs} can enhance originality. Notably, our findings reveal a consensus between human evaluations and {LLMs} regarding the personality traits that influence creativity. The findings underscore the significant impact of {LLM} design on creativity and bridges artificial intelligence and human creativity, offering insights into {LLMs}' creativity and potential applications.},

	abstract = {We obtain the first analytic, interpretable and predictive theory of creativity in convolutional diffusion models. Indeed, score-based diffusion models can generate highly creative images that lie far from their training data. But optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in a fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, equivariant local score ({ELS}) machine that, (3) without any training can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like {ResNets} and {UNets}) with high accuracy (median \$r{\textasciicircum}2\$ of \$0.90, 0.91, 0.94\$ on {CIFAR}10, {FashionMNIST}, and {MNIST}). Our {ELS} machine reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic model of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches in different image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled {UNets} (median \$r{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}sim 0.75\$ on {CIFAR}10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.},

	title = {{MARBLE}: Music Audio Representation Benchmark for Universal Evaluation},
	abstract = {In the era of extensive intersection between art and Artificial Intelligence ({AI}), such as image generation and fiction co-creation, {AI} for music remains relatively nascent, particularly in music understanding. This is evident in the limited work on deep music representations, the scarcity of large-scale datasets, and the absence of a universal and community-driven benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce the Music Audio Representation Benchmark for {universaL} Evaluation, termed {MARBLE}. It aims to provide a benchmark for various Music Information Retrieval ({MIR}) tasks by defining a comprehensive taxonomy with four hierarchy levels, including acoustic, performance, score, and high-level description. We establish a unified protocol based on 18 tasks on 12 public-available datasets, providing a fair and standard assessment of representations of all open-sourced pre-trained models developed on music recordings as baselines. {MARBLE} offers an easy-to-use, extendable, and reproducible suite for the community, with clear statements on dataset copyright. Results suggest that recently proposed large-scale pre-trained musical language models perform the best in most tasks, with room for further improvement. The leaderboard and toolkit repository are published34 to promote future music {AI} research.},

To this end, we create {MACGYVER}, an automatically generated dataset consisting of over 1,600 real-world problems deliberately designed to trigger innovative usage of objects and necessitate out-of-the-box thinking. We then present our collection to both {LLMs} and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. {MACGYVER} is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. In contrast, {LLMs}, exposed to a variety of specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing physicallyinfeasible actions. This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking, which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2) provides insight into the constrained problemsolving capabilities of both humans and {AI}.},

Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and {AI} are better than either alone. Here, we addressed this question by conducting a meta-analysis of over 100 recent experimental studies reporting over 300 effect sizes. First, we found that, on average, human-{AI} combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or {AI} alone. Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed {AI} alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when the {AI} outperformed humans alone we found losses. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human-{AI} collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human-{AI} systems.},

	abstract = {Creative problem-solving is a naturalistic form of creative thinking involving the generation of solutions that are not only original but also of high quality (i.e., plausible and effective). Naturalistic tasks that evaluate both originality and quality are vital for the promotion of creativity in real-world settings—yet scoring such tasks remains challenging, due to costly human labor required to manually rate task responses. Past work has shown that large language models ({LLMs}) can be trained to predict human originality ratings of responses to tests of divergent thinking. In the present research, we extend this work to creative problem-solving, examining whether both originality and quality can be automatically scored for a naturalistic creativity task. We gathered data from 10 studies, amounting to 3,235 participants who completed a creative problem-solving task ({CPST}). We then fine-tuned two open-source {LLMs}, {RoBERTa} and {GPT}-2, to predict human ratings of originality and quality on the {CPST}, and compared their performance to two other scoring methods: elaboration (i.e., word count) and semantic distance. We found that {RoBERTa} and {GPT}-2 models predict solution quality ({RoBERTa}, r = .83; {GPT}-2, r = .83) better than solution originality ({RoBERTa}, r = .79; {GPT}-2, r = .80). Moreover, we found that both models outperformed elaboration and semantic distance methods and generalized to new {CPST} items not present in their training set. We therefore show for the first time that naturalistic creativity tasks can be automatically scored for both originality and quality. Open access is provided to the models and training data.},

However, research on {LLM} creativity has focused solely on {\textbackslash}textit\{products\}, with little attention on the creative {\textbackslash}textit\{process\}. Process analyses of human creativity often require hand-coded categories or exploit response times, which do not apply to {LLMs}. We provide an automated method to characterise how humans and {LLMs} explore semantic spaces on the Alternate Uses Task, and contrast with behaviour in a Verbal Fluency Task. We use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic similarities, which we use to generate jump profiles. Our results corroborate earlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic spaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to creativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores. {LLMs} were found to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied across tasks. Though {LLMs} as a population match human profiles, their relationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score higher on creativity.

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) are applied to all sorts of creative tasks, and their outputs vary from beautiful, to peculiar, to pastiche, into plain plagiarism. The temperature parameter of an {LLM} regulates the amount of randomness, leading to more diverse outputs; therefore, it is often claimed to be the creativity parameter. Here, we investigate this claim using a narrative generation task with a predetermined fixed context, model and prompt. Specifically, we present an empirical analysis of the {LLM} output for different temperature values using four necessary conditions for creativity in narrative generation: novelty, typicality, cohesion, and coherence. We find that temperature is weakly correlated with novelty, and unsurprisingly, moderately correlated with incoherence, but there is no relationship with either cohesion or typicality. However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than suggested by the "creativity parameter" claim; overall results suggest that the {LLM} generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures get higher. Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled {LLM} creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.},

We recruit 10 creative writers and implement a human assessment of 48 stories written either by professional authors or {LLMs} using {TTCW}. Our analysis shows that {LLM}-generated stories pass 3-10X less {TTCW} tests than stories written by professionals. In addition, we explore the use of {LLMs} as assessors to automate the {TTCW} evaluation, revealing that none of the {LLMs} positively correlate with the expert assessments.},

To this end, we propose {LLM} Discussion, a three-phase discussion framework that facilitates vigorous and diverging idea exchanges and ensures convergence to creative answers. Moreover, we adopt a role-playing technique by assigning distinct roles to {LLMs} to combat the homogeneity of {LLMs}. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework with the Alternative Uses Test, Similarities Test, Instances Test, and Scientific Creativity Test through both {LLM} evaluation and human study.

In the first part of the paper I propose to replace the question of whether a computer can be creative with questions over the intentionality displayed by the system. The notion of creativity is indeed embedded with our subjective judgement and this prevents us from giving an objective evaluation of an idea or product as creative. In Sect. 2, I suggest to shift the focus of the inquiry to the autonomy possessed by the software. I finally argue that the application of generative adversarial networks to music generators provides the software with a level of autonomy sufficient to deem it able to create musical works.},

Study 1 tested observers’ ability to discriminate between computer-generated and man-made art, and then examined how categorization of art works impacted on perceived aesthetic value, revealing a bias against computer-generated art. In Study 2 this bias was reproduced in the context of robotic art; however, it was found to be reversed when observers were given the opportunity to see robotic artists in action. These findings reveal an explicit prejudice against computer-generated art, driven largely by the kind of art observers believe computer algorithms are capable of producing. These prejudices can be overridden in circumstances in which observers are able to infer anthropomorphic characteristics in the computer programs, a finding which has implications for the future of artistic {AI}.},

	abstract = {In classical music listening, program announcements both on radio and in concerts will usually introduce the performance of a symphony with the same minimal articles of information, such as the composer, the order of composition, the key, and the name, if any. But how much can a listener infer about the musical attributes of the work from these basic facts? Examination of 99 symphonies by 13 symphonists between Beethoven and Shostakovich showed that such rudimentary programmatic data can predict several subjective and objective features, including aesthetic significance, listener accessibility, repertoire popularity, melodic originality, originality variation, and playing time. Discussion follows about what these empirical relationships may imply about how composers create their symphonies and how appreciators perceive those musical products.},

Three experiments were carried out, using the violation of expectation ({VoE}) paradigm. During the familiariza­ tion phase, infants saw events in which negative interactions involving two spheres as third parties were presented, while another shape intervened (inter­ vening event) or not (non-intervening event), and a bystander watched these interactions. In Experiment 1, a sphere moved towards another sphere that started to move before the contact (social causality); in Experiment 2, a sphere moved towards another sphere that started to move after the contact (physical causality); in Experiment 3, a sphere moved towards fixed objects (physical causality). In the two test trials, either the intervening or the non-intervening agent needed help to enter into a box, and the bystander helped either agent. Later, a manual choice task assessed infants’ preferences. The results demon­ strated that only in the social condition infants expected a bystander to help an intervening agent, and preferred the intervening agent. The findings provided evidence that infants’ evaluations are triggered by the perception of social causality.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that titles influence peoples’ evaluation of visual art. However, the question of whether titles and artist names affect listeners when evaluating music has not yet been investigated. By using two well-known cognitive heuristics, we investigated whether names presented with music pieces influenced aesthetic and value judgements of music. Experiment 1 (N= 48) focused on linguistic fluency. The same music excerpts were presented with easy-topronounce (fluent) and difficult-to-pronounce (disfluent) names. Experiment 2 (N= 100) studied the affect heuristic. The same music excerpts were presented with positive (e.g., Kiss), negative (e.g., Suicide), and neutral (e.g., Window) titles. In both studies, aesthetic and value judgements of music were significantly influenced by the linguistic manipulation of the names. Participants in Experiment 1 evaluated the same music more positively when presented with fluent names compared to disfluent names. In Experiment 2, presenting the music with negative titles resulted in the lowest judgements. Moreover, music excerpts presented with neutral and negative titles were remembered significantly more often than positive titles. Finally, a comparison of the music presented with and without titles indicated that music excerpts were more liked in the presence of titles than in their absence. The present research shows different ways in which aesthetic and value judgements can be influenced by names presented with music. Results suggest that like any other human judgement, evaluations of music also rely on heuristic principles that do not necessarily depend on the aesthetic stimuli themselves.},

	abstract = {Cognitive approaches have recently been proposed for understanding art appreciation, emphasizing the role of perceived artist’s intentions and messages in how lay people define what is “art” and what is “good” art. In particular, it is argued that a work of art automatically triggers speculation about the artist’s intention, and that it is intuitively assessed as an act of symbolic communication. The current experimental study tested these claims by presenting participants with various artifacts and works of art, alongside differing levels of information regarding the artist’s intentions, and asking them to rate the artifacts on artistic merit. In total, 505 adults participated in four experiments. In experiment 1, participants used the artists’ putative intentions to decide whether certain artifacts were instances of “art.” In experiments 2a and 2b, titles that ostensibly clarified the artists’ messages were found to increase participants’ understanding and, importantly, liking of a series of works of art. In experiment 3, high levels of perceived investment from artists were found to increase how much participants liked a series of paintings. Overall, the results suggest that perceived artists’ intentions and messages affect what people consider to be art and good art. The art experience is not only about beauty or hedonistic pleasure, but involves assessment of the artist’s intention and of the history behind the work of art.},

To date there is no evidence on whether human products, which signal the workings of a mind in the absence of an explicit agent, also reliably engage neural structures typically associated with mental state attribution. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging the present study shows that when subjects believe they are listening to a piece of music that was written by a composer (i.e., human product) as opposed to generated by a computer (i.e., nonhuman product), activations in the cortical network typically reported for mental state attribution (anterior medial frontal cortex [{aMFC}]), superior temporal sulcus, and temporal poles) were observed. The activation in the {aMFC} correlated highly with the extent to which subjects had engaged in attributing the expression of intentions to the composed pieces, as indicated in a postimaging questionnaire. We interpret these ﬁndings as indicative of automatic mechanisms, which reﬂect mental state attribution in the face of any stimulus that potentially signals the working of another mind and conclude that even in the absence of a socially salient stimulus, our environment is still populated by the indirect social signals inherent to human artifacts.},

In this study, we explore a notion of rationality based on the idea of evolutionary ﬁtness. We ask whether agents that are more adapted to their environment are, consequently, perceived as more rational and intentional. We created a 2-D virtual environment populated with autonomous virtual agents, each of which behaves according to a built-in program equipped with simulated perception, memory, and decision making. We then introduced a process of simulated evolution that pressured the agents’ programs toward behavior more adapted to the simulated environment. We showed these agents to human subjects in 2 experiments, in which we respectively asked them to judge their intelligence and to dynamically estimate their “mental states.” The results conﬁrm that subjects construed evolved agents as more intelligent, and judged evolved agents’ mental states more accurately, relative to nonevolved agents. These results corroborate a view that the interpretation of agent behavior is connected to a concept of rationality based on the apparent ﬁt between an agent’s actions and its environment.},

Toward this end, two experiments investigated factors contributing to listeners’ narrative engagement with music, comparing the narrative experiences of Western and Chinese instrumental music for listeners in two suburban locations in the United States with those of listeners living in a remote rural village in China with different patterns of musical exposure. Supporting an enculturation perspective where learned extramusical associations (i.e., Topicality) play an important role in narrative perceptions of music, results from the first experiment show that for Western listeners, greater Topicality, rather than greater Contrast, increases narrative engagement, as long as listeners have sufficient exposure to its patterns of use within a culture. Strengthening this interpretation, results for the second experiment, which directly manipulated Topicality and Contrast, show that reducing an excerpt’s Topicality, but not its Contrast reduces listeners’ narrative engagement.},

Within a 2 × 2 design the descriptions (a) attributed the musical piece to different composers of highly different prominence and prestige. Half of the participant group was informed that they would be listening to the overture to the pastoral opera Ascanio in Alba by Wolfgang Amadé Mozart (1756–1791), whereas the other half was informed correctly. The composers’ names were (b) combined with descriptions that applied either an analytic or expressive writing mode. Subsequently collected ratings for liking and a number of perceived musical characteristics were significantly higher when participants had read the expressive compared with the analytic writing mode. Interestingly, younger adults showed higher liking ratings when the music was attributed to Mozart, whereas no significant differences were found in older adults.

This paradigm confounds whether the opponent is natural or artificial and whether it is intentional or an automaton. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the intentional stance by orthogonally varying perceptions of the opponents' intentionality (responding actively or passively according to a script) and embodiment (human or a computer). The mere perception of the opponent (whether human or computer) as intentional activated the mentalizing network: the temporoparietal junction ({TPJ}) bilaterally, right temporal pole, anterior paracingulate cortex ({aPCC}) and the precuneus. Interacting with humans versus computers induced activations in a more circumscribed right lateralized subnetwork within the mentalizing network, consisting of the {TPJ} and the {aPCC}, possibly reflective of the tendency to spontaneously attribute intentionality to humans. The interaction between intentionality (active versus passive) and opponent (human versus computer) recruited the left frontal pole, possibly in response to violations of the default intentional stance towards humans and computers. Employing an orthogonal design is important to adequately capture Dennett's conception of the intentional stance as a mentalizing strategy that can apply equally well to humans and other intentional agents.},

	abstract = {A pressing issue concerns how to reduce stereotypic responses and discriminatory outcomes resulting from the operation of implicit biases. One possibility is that cognitive retraining, such as by repeatedly practicing counterstereotypes, can reduce implicit bias so that stereotype application will be reduced in turn. Another possibility involves motivated self-regulation, where people's awareness of their proneness to biased responses heightens negative self-directed affect, which in turn facilitates monitoring for biases and reduces stereotype application. These possibilities were tested across three experiments. In all experiments, participants who completed counterstereotype training subsequently scored lower on a measure of implicit bias, relative to untrained participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, counterstereotyping did not reduce subsequent stereotype application; in Experiment 3, counterstereotyping did reduce stereotype application, but this effect was not mediated by implicit bias scores. Participants in the motivated self-regulation condition (Experiments 2 \& 3) were primed with their proneness to respond in biased ways, which increased negative self-directed affect among participants more internally motivated to respond without bias. Participants' degree of negative self-directed affect was not consistently associated with implicit bias scores. However, greater negative self-directed affect was associated with reduced stereotype application (Experiment 2) and greater rejection of racist jokes (Experiment 3). These results suggest that reductions of implicit bias through counterstereotype training do not, in turn, lead to reduced stereotype application. In contrast, the results support the viability of motivated self-regulation interventions that facilitate awareness of bias and heighten negative self-directed affect, thus creating the motivation to self-regulate stereotype application.

Contemporary theories of prejudice suggest that awareness of personal bias is a critical step in reducing one's prejudice and discrimination. When bias is a cloaked in a way that people do not recognize, they are likely to continue to perpetuate their biased behaviors and unlikely to reduce their negative attitudes. However, when people become aware of their biases, they often adjust their attitudes and behavior to be more egalitarian. The present research investigated (a) individual differences in Whites' awareness of their propensity to express subtly biased behavior against Blacks in interracial contexts (Study 1), (b) the convergent and discriminant validity of a new individual difference measure of bias awareness (Studies 1, 2, and 3), (c) whether this measure uniquely predicts Whites' responses to a difficult race-related context—receiving feedback that they are high in implicit bias from an Implicit Association Test (R-{IAT}; Study 2), and (d) whether this measure uniquely predicts Whites' perceptions of others' racial bias, particularly subtle expressions (Study 3). Results revealed that the Bias Awareness Scale measures a distinct construct that uniquely predicts Whites' emotional and behavioral responses to information about their own bias, and their ability to detect bias in others.

              Inspired by the increasing use of artificial intelligence ({AI}) to augment humans, researchers have studied human–{AI} systems involving different tasks, systems and populations. Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and {AI} are better than either alone. Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems {eLibrary}) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, {AI} alone and human–{AI} combinations. First, we found that, on average, human–{AI} combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or {AI} alone (Hedges’
              g
               = −0.23; 95\% confidence interval, −0.39 to −0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed {AI} alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when {AI} outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human–{AI} collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human–{AI} systems.},

We then present our collection to both {LLMs} and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. {MACGYVER} is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. In contrast, {LLMs}, exposed to a variety of specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing physically-infeasible actions. Finally, we provide a detailed error analysis of {LLMs}, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and divergent-convergent thinking. This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking, which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2) provides insight into the constrained problem-solving capabilities of both humans and {AI}.},

Here, we conduct a listening study to comparatively evaluate several music generation systems along six musical dimensions: stylistic success, aesthetic pleasure, repetition or self-reference, melody, harmony, and rhythm. A range of models, both deep learning algorithms and other methods, are used to generate 30-s excerpts in the style of Classical string quartets and classical piano improvisations. Fifty participants with relatively high musical knowledge rate unlabelled samples of computer-generated and human-composed excerpts for the six musical dimensions. We use non-parametric Bayesian hypothesis testing to interpret the results, allowing the possibility of finding meaningful non-differences between systems’ performance. We find that the strongest deep learning method, a reimplemented version of Music Transformer, has equivalent performance to a non-deep learning method, {MAIA} Markov, demonstrating that to date, deep learning does not outperform other methods for {AMG}. We also find there still remains a significant gap between any algorithmic method and humancomposed excerpts.},

            In the alternative uses task ({AUT}), a well-established creativity assessment, participants propose alternative uses for common items (e.g., a brick) within a 2–3 min timeframe. While idea evaluation is likely involved, the emphasis is strongly on idea generation. Here, we test the value of presenting a word overlapping an image compared to a word only prompt, and we introduce a cyclic adaptation of the {AUT} explicitly calling on participants to choose their best idea. In Experiment 1, as compared to word only, word + image prompts increased idea fluency but reduced idea originality and variability within a group of native Polish speakers. Thus, word + image prompts improve {AUT} baselining. In Experiment 2, different participants produced as many ideas as possible within two minutes (List) or their single best idea at the end of each of three 30 s ideation cycles (Cycle). Although originality did not differ between List and Cycle overall, the first three ideas in List were rated as less creative than the ideas in Cycle. Overall, we conclude that using disambiguating images reduces spurious interindividual variability in the {AUT} while introducing idea evaluation in the task allows us to assess creativity beyond idea generation.},

We build semantic networks where nodes represent word stems in a particular idea generation topic, and edge weights capture the degree of novelty versus familiarity of word stem combinations (i.e., the weight of an edge that connects two word stems measures their scaled co-occurrence in the relevant language). Each idea contains a set of word stems, which form a semantic subnetwork. The edge weight distribution in that subnetwork reﬂects how the idea balances novelty with familiarity. Based on the “beauty in averageness” eﬀect, we hypothesize that ideas with semantic subnetworks that have a more prototypical edge weight distribution are judged as more creative. We show this eﬀect in eight studies involving over 4,000 ideas across multiple domains. Practically, we demonstrate how our research can be used to automatically identify promising ideas and recommend words to users on the ﬂy to help them improve their ideas.},

            Creativity is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. However, achieving creativity is often considered a challenging task, particularly in design. In recent years, using computational machines to support people in creative activities in design, such as idea generation and evaluation, has become a popular research topic. Although there exist many creativity support tools, few of them could produce creative solutions in a direct manner, but produce stimuli instead. {DALL}·E is currently the most advanced computational model that could generate creative ideas in pictorial formats based on textual descriptions. This study conducts a Turing test, a computational test, and an expert test to evaluate {DALL}·E’s capability in achieving combinational creativity comparing with human designers. The results reveal that {DALL}·E could achieve combinational creativity at a similar level to novice designers and indicate the differences between computer and human creativity.},

We then propose a novel text analysis methodology that we use to determine what specifically {GPT}4 is doing to achieve these superior results. We develop measures of two types of creativity: creative form (i.e., the language used to describe an idea being more unusual or unique) and creative substance (i.e., the idea itself is more novel). We find that {GPT}4 outperforms humans in both types of creativity. Finally, we show that using {GPT}4 to simply re-write ideas originally written by humans results in those ideas being rated as significantly more creative and that the improvement is explained by creativity in form. These results have immediate implications for managers, researchers, and practitioners in various fields, as integrating {AI} systems may optimize creative processes, save resources, and accelerate innovation cycles.},

We find that compared to adults, children spend a higher percentage of their search exploring, and their exploitation phases are less efficient. Moreover, children orient their search to a different and smaller region of the search space, but within that space they produce more unique creative products. Lastly, as children grow up, their creative products become more adult-like and their uniqueness decreases. Together, these results suggest that creative search changes across development, in the search strategy employed, in how the space of possibilities is navigated, and in what ideas are ultimately chosen.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality ({VR}) is considered a compelling tool to foster creativity by allowing its users to create in 3D space. However, the challenge lies in understanding how people use these tools and what they create, hindering the drawing of meaningful conclusions about {VR} as a viable tool for creativity. Furthermore, past research has shown that contextual factors shape how people create within {VR}, suggesting the existence of other factors. Here, we analyze the 3D creations of 137 participants responding to different creativity activities across seven sessions on a social {VR} platform. Specifically, we evaluate the role of virtual mobility, the capacity to move freely or have restricted movement in virtual space. We additionally present a {VR}-specific creativity coding scheme that follows recommendations from previous literature. Using dimensions derived from this coding scheme, we examine how these dimensions relate to behaviors and features of the creations in the context of virtual mobility. Results showed the significant role of virtual mobility on the design process, such that participants iterated and revised more by deleting more when their avatars were allowed to teleport and translate freely, compared to when their avatar’s movements were restricted to sitting down in virtual chairs. Furthermore, participants built shorter creations and took up less projection space with restricted virtual mobility. Results also showed that participants created more practical, unique, and well-implemented creations the more 3D models they used. Similarly, the more participants deleted, the more well-implemented the creations were. We discuss implications for designers of creation-oriented {VR} platforms and pedagogy for instructors facilitating activities in educational contexts.},

Our work serves as a first step in determining which particular representations and competences, as well as which kinds of knowledge or skill, can be derived from particular learning techniques and data. In particular, we explore which kinds of cognitive capacities can be enabled by statistical analysis of large-scale linguistic data.

	abstract = {Despite six decades of creative cognition research, measures of creative ideation have heavily relied on divergent thinking tasks, which still suffer from conceptual, design, and psychometric shortcomings. These shortcomings have greatly impeded the accurate study of creative ideation, its dynamics, development, and integration as part of a comprehensive psychological assessment. After a brief overview of the historical and current anchoring of creative ideation measurement, overlooked challenges in its most common operationalization (i.e., divergent thinking tasks framework) are discussed. They include (1) the reliance on a single stimulus as a starting point of the creative ideation process (stimulus-dependency), (2) the analysis of response quality based on a varying number of observations across test-takers (ﬂuency-dependency), and (3) the production of “static” cumulative performance indicators. Inspired from an emerging line of work from the ﬁeld of cognitive neuroscience of creativity, this paper introduces a new assessment framework referred to as “Multi-Trial Creative Ideation” ({MTCI}). This framework shifts the current measurement paradigm by (1) offering a variety of stimuli presented in a well-deﬁned set of ideation “trials,” (2) reinterprets the concept of ideational ﬂuency using a time-analysis of idea generation, and (3) captures individual dynamics in the ideation process (e.g., modeling the effort-time required to reach a response of maximal uncommonness) while controlling for stimulus-speciﬁc sources of variation. Advantages of the {MTCI} framework over the classic divergent thinking paradigm are discussed in light of current directions in the ﬁeld of creativity research.},

	doi = {10.1037/met0000300},
	abstract = {Selective reporting of results based on their statistical significance threatens the validity of meta-analytic findings. A variety of techniques for detecting selective reporting, publication bias, or small-study effects are available and are routinely used in research syntheses. Most such techniques are univariate, in that they assume that each study contributes a single, independent effect size estimate to the meta-analysis. In practice, however, studies often contribute multiple, statistically dependent effect size estimates, such as for multiple measures of a common outcome construct. Many methods are available for meta-analyzing dependent effect sizes, but methods for investigating selective reporting while also handling effect size dependencies require further investigation. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate three available univariate tests for small-study effects or selective reporting, including the trim and fill test, Egger’s regression test, and a likelihood ratio test from a three-parameter selection model (3PSM), when dependence is ignored or handled using ad hoc techniques. We also examine two variants of Egger’s regression test that incorporate robust variance estimation ({RVE}) or multilevel meta-analysis ({MLMA}) to handle dependence. Simulation results demonstrate that ignoring dependence inflates Type I error rates for all univariate tests. Variants of Egger’s regression maintain Type I error rates when dependent effect sizes are sampled or handled using {RVE} or {MLMA}. The 3PSM likelihood ratio test does not fully control Type I error rates. With the exception of the 3PSM, all methods have limited power to detect selection bias except under strong selection for statistically significant effects.

We introduce the Theory of Mind module that scaffolds the high-level planning process by generating hypotheses about other agents' strategies in natural language. It then evaluates and iteratively refines these hypotheses by reinforcing hypotheses that make correct predictions about the other agents' behavior. Hypothetical Minds significantly improves performance over previous {LLM}-agent and {RL} baselines on a range of competitive, mixed motive, and collaborative domains in the Melting Pot benchmark, including both dyadic and population-based environments.

After critically reviewing the notion of accuracy in creativity judgments, this article explores whether (1) people in general are discerning and (2) whether some people are more discerning than others. University students (n = 226) completed four divergent thinking tasks and then decided which responses were their most creative. Judges then rated the creativity of all of the responses. Multilevel latent-variable models found that people's choices strongly agreed with judges' ratings of the responses; overall, people were discerning in their decisions. But some people were more discerning than others: people high in openness to experience, in particular, had stronger agreement between their decisions and the judges' ratings. Creative people are thus doubly skilled: they are better at generating good ideas and at picking their best ideas. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

U.S. American adults completed two tasks designed to measure creativity. Before each creativity trial, participants completed an unrelated search of a city map. Between subjects, we manipulated the search pattern, with some participants seeking multiple, dispersed spatial locations and others repeatedly converging on the same location. Participants who searched divergently in space were better at divergent thinking but worse at convergent thinking; this pattern reversed for participants who had converged repeatedly on a single location. These results demonstrate a targeted link between foraging and creativity, thus advancing our understanding of the origins and mechanisms of high-level cognition.},

We propose that visual systems are space-time fitters, meaning visual development can be understood as a blind fitting process (akin to evolution) in which visual systems gradually adapt to the spatiotemporal data distributions in the newborn’s environment. To test whether space-time fitting is a viable theory for learning how to see, we performed parallel controlled-rearing experiments on newborn chicks and deep neural networks ({DNNs}), including {CNNs} and transformers. First, we raised newborn chicks in impoverished environments containing a single object, then simulated those environments in a video game engine. Second, we recorded first-person images from agents moving through the virtual animal chambers and used those images to train {DNNs}. Third, we compared the viewpoint-invariant object recognition performance of the chicks and {DNNs}. When {DNNs} received the same visual diet (training data) as chicks, the models developed common object recognition skills as chicks. {DNNs} that used time as a teaching signal—space-time fitters—also showed common patterns of successes and failures across the test viewpoints as chicks. Thus, {DNNs} can learn object recognition in the same impoverished environments as newborn animals. We argue that space-time fitters can serve as formal scientific models of newborn visual systems, providing image-computable models for studying how newborns learn to see from raw visual experiences.},

	abstract = {Abstract reasoning is a key ability for an intelligent system. Large language models ({LMs}) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. Human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable “content effects”; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns are central to debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models—whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge—similarly mix content into their answers to logic problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art {LMs}, as well as humans, and find that the {LMs} reflect many of the same qualitative human patterns on these tasks—like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected in accuracy patterns, and in some lower-level features like the relationship between {LM} confidence over possible answers and human response times. However, in some cases the humans and models behave differently—particularly on the Wason task, where humans perform much worse than large models, and exhibit a distinct error pattern. Our findings have implications for understanding possible contributors to these human cognitive effects, as well as the factors that influence language model performance.},

	abstract = {Background and aims
Mobile phone bans in secondary schools are claimed to reduce student distraction and promote learning and face-to-face socializing. Currently, the evidence on phone bans is limited. The aim of this preregistered study was to evaluate the South Australian mobile phone ban's effects on students' problematic phone use, academic engagement, school belonging, and bullying. The study also sought to identify student variables that predict phone ban compliance.

Methods
As the ban was phased in over 2023, a 2 (phone ban: yes/no) × 2 (time: baseline, 1-month follow-up) repeated-measures design was employed. Students (n = 1,282 at baseline; n = 1,256 at follow-up) in Grades 7 to 12 were recruited from five public secondary schools. Surveys included measures drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children ({LSAC}) and the Programme for International Student Assessment ({PISA}).

Results
Problematic phone use was reported by 2.6\% of the sample. Being older and a more frequent user of social media predicted lower phone ban compliance. Linear mixed models indicated that ban and no ban school groups did not differ significantly in terms of problematic phone use, academic engagement, and school belonging. There was slightly higher bullying in the ban group but bullying decreased significantly in both groups.

Discussion
Imposing access restrictions may not affect the underlying psychological mechanisms that drive problematic phone use. Although these results indicate limited to no short-term benefits of the ban, further evaluation with more sensitive methodologies is recommended.

Conclusions
Student-technology interactions in learning institutions should be continually monitored to determine the optimal balance to support student etiquette, learning, and wellbeing.},

Generative artificial intelligence ({AI})—including powerful large language models ({LLMs})—holds promise for humans to be more creative by offering new ideas, or less creative by anchoring on generative {AI} ideas. We study the causal impact of generative {AI} ideas on the production of short stories in an online experiment where some writers obtained story ideas from an {LLM}. We find that access to generative {AI} ideas causes stories to be evaluated as more creative, better written, and more enjoyable, especially among less creative writers. However, generative {AI}–enabled stories are more similar to each other than stories by humans alone. These results point to an increase in individual creativity at the risk of losing collective novelty. This dynamic resembles a social dilemma: With generative {AI}, writers are individually better off, but collectively a narrower scope of novel content is produced. Our results have implications for researchers, policy-makers, and practitioners interested in bolstering creativity.

We varied the number of {AI}-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as '{AI}' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having {LLMs} 'in the culture loop'. We find that high {AI} exposure (but not low {AI} exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. {AI} made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from {AI} and that participants may knowingly adopt {AI} ideas when the task is difficult.

            Creativity has traditionally been considered an ability exclusive to human beings. However, the rapid development of artificial intelligence ({AI}) has resulted in generative {AI} chatbots that can produce high-quality artworks, raising questions about the differences between human and machine creativity. In this study, we compared the creativity of humans (n = 256) with that of three current {AI} chatbots using the alternate uses task ({AUT}), which is the most used divergent thinking task. Participants were asked to generate uncommon and creative uses for everyday objects. On average, the {AI} chatbots outperformed human participants. While human responses included poor-quality ideas, the chatbots generally produced more creative responses. However, the best human ideas still matched or exceed those of the chatbots. While this study highlights the potential of {AI} as a tool to enhance creativity, it also underscores the unique and complex nature of human creativity that may be difficult to fully replicate or surpass with {AI} technology. The study provides insights into the relationship between human and machine creativity, which is related to important questions about the future of creative work in the age of {AI}.},

	abstract = {Making online social communities ‘better’ is a challenging undertaking, as online communities are extraordinarily varied in their size, topical focus, and governance. As such, what is valued by one community may not be valued by another. In this work, we measure community values through a survey of 2,769 reddit users in 2,151 unique subreddits, the largest survey of community values to date. Through a combination of survey responses and a quantitative analysis of publicly available reddit data, we characterize how these values vary within and across communities. We find that there is 47.4\% more disagreement over how safe communities are than disagreement over other aspects of communities’ current state, that longstanding communities place 30.1\% more emphasis on trustworthiness than newer communities, and that recently joined redditors perceive their communities more positively than more senior redditors. We find that community moderators want their communities to be 56.7\% less democratic than non-moderator community members. Accurate and scalable modeling of community values enables research and governance which is tuned to each community’s different values. To this end, we demonstrate that a small number of automatically quantifiable features captures a substantial amount of the variation in values between communities with a {ROC} {AUC} of 0.667 on a binary classification task. However, significant variation remains, and modeling community values remains an important topic for future work. We make our models and data public to inform community design and governance.},

Although tales of past panics are often met with amusement today, current concerns routinely engender large research investments and policy debate. What we learn from studying past technological panics, however, is that these investments are often inefficient and ineffective. What causes technological panics to repeatedly reincarnate? And why does research routinely fail to address them? To answer such questions, I examined the network of political, population, and academic factors driving the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics. In this cycle, psychologists are encouraged to spend time investigating new technologies, and how they affect children and young people, to calm a worried population. Their endeavor, however, is rendered ineffective because of the lack of a theoretical baseline; researchers cannot build on what has been learned researching past technologies of concern. Thus, academic study seemingly restarts for each new technology of interest, which slows down the policy interventions necessary to ensure technologies are benefiting society. In this article, I highlight how the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics stymies psychology?s positive role in steering technological change and the pervasive need for improved research and policy approaches to new technologies.},

Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using {GenAI} in work tasks. Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specific factors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence in {GenAI} are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted and the effort of doing so in {GenAI}-assisted tasks. Specifically, higher confidence in {GenAI} is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking. Qualitatively, {GenAI} shifts the nature of critical thinking toward information verification, response integration, and task stewardship. Our insights reveal new design challenges and opportunities for developing {GenAI} tools for knowledge work.},

Going beyond the existing literature, the present study evaluated the association between two sources of belongingness, namely sense of belonging at school ({SOBAS}) and on social media ({SOBOSM}), and both psychological maladjustment and educational achievement. Sample consisted of 698 early-to-late adolescents (52.3\% female, mean age = 13.79 ± 2.09). Both {SOBAS} and {SOBOSM} showed negative direct associations with psychological maladjustment. {SOBOSM} showed a negative direct association with educational achievement. Social media addiction mediated the links between both {SOBAS} and {SOBOSM} and psychological maladjustment and education achievement. Overall, findings suggest that adolescents reporting high sense of belonging both at school and on social media may at lower risk for psychological maladjustment. However, adolescents reporting low {SOBAS} and high {SOBOSM} may also be a greater risk of {SMA}, possibly impacting their psychological health and school adjustement.},

	abstract = {Most studies of social relationships in later life focus on the amount of social contact, not on individuals' perceptions of social isolation. However, loneliness is likely to be an important aspect of aging. A major limiting factor in studying loneliness has been the lack of a measure suitable for large-scale social surveys. This article describes a short loneliness scale developed specifically for use on a telephone survey. The scale has three items and a simplified set of response categories but appears to measure overall loneliness quite well. The authors also document the relationship between loneliness and several commonly used measures of objective social isolation. As expected, they find that objective and subjective isolation are related. However, the relationship is relatively modest, indicating that the quantitative and qualitative aspects of social relationships are distinct. This result suggests the importance of studying both dimensions of social relationships in the aging process.},

Factor analyses yielded three dimensions of parent satisfaction with teacher contact experiences, classroom contact experiences, and school contact experiences. Multivariate analyses showed that parents with children in Head Start or kindergarten were more satisﬁed in all three dimensions than were parents of children in child care or ﬁrst grade. Married parents were more satisﬁed with their teacher contact than were single parents and parents who were not employed full-time were more satisﬁed with their contact across all three dimensions than were parents who were employed full-time.

	abstract = {Parent-teacher relationship ({PTR}) quality is linked to child and family-school functioning and may be especially important in the school adjustment of autistic children. However, measurement of {PTR} quality has been limited by inconsistency in the use of measures, a paucity of twoinformant measurement, and limited psychometric consideration. We examined the psychometric properties of the Parent-Teacher Relationship Quality Scale ({PTRQS}), a parent- and teacherreport measure of {PTR} quality derived from multiple sources. Specifically, we examined the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of the {PTRQS} among parents and teachers of 192 autistic children in preschool to 2nd grade. Results supported a three-factor model, including (1) parent-perceived relationship quality, (2) teacher-perceived comfort with parent(s), and (3) teacher perceptions of parent abilities. Scores exhibited high internal consistency. As evidence of convergent validity, all three factors of {PTR} quality, as well as the total {PTRQS} score, were strongly associated with parent interview-based {PTR} quality, parent perceptions of teacher effectiveness, and teacher-rated parental school involvement. The two teacher-rated {PTR} quality factors were also associated with student-teacher relationship quality. Results indicated that (a) the measure can validly capture {PTR} quality in the context of preschool and early elementary-age autistic children, (b) early {PTR} quality is linked to parental involvement, and (c) teacher-rated {PTR} factors are linked to autistic students' own relationships with their teachers. The results have implications for researchers and school psychologists measuring {PTR} quality in their practice.},

Lack of control over children’s smartphone use, in turn, was related to conflict about the smartphone from children’s and parents’ perspectives over time. The relations with conflict were independent of whether parents thought that smartphones have negative effects on children.

	abstract = {Work and organizational psychology has long been concerned with measuring job satisfaction in organizational contexts, and this has carried across to the field of education, leading to a research focus on the work-related satisfaction of teachers. Today, a myriad of organizations continue to assess employees’ job satisfaction on a routine basis (Liu, Borg, \& Spector, 2004). Unfortunately, a sort of balkanization of the field has resulted in the production of dozens of specific measurement tools, making it difficult to cross-compare samples and contexts. The present paper tested the measurement invariance of the Teacher Job Satisfaction Scale ({TJSS}) in six international cohorts (Netherlands, United States, Russia China, Italy and Palestine) of in-service teachers (N = 2,819). Confirmatory factor analysis and multi-group invariance tests were applied. The {TJSS}-9 displayed robust psychometric proprieties and no substantial departures from measurement invariance (configural and metric). Future research is required to further test equivalence across additional countries, with view to developing a truly international tool for measuring job satisfaction in teaching.},

Methods:           A study was conducted with high school adolescents from Southern Brazil enrolled in public education (2019). The {QueST} measures screen time across five constructs: studying, working/internship-related activities, watching videos, playing games, using social media/chat applications. Content validation involved consulting with experts and adolescents to evaluate whether the five constructs were clear and representing screen time behaviors, all ratings were quantified. The experts’ evaluation provided Content Validity Indexes ({CVI}) for clarity and representativeness of the questionnaire. Students answered the {QueST} twice (1-week apart), and differences between applications were verified. Test-retest reliability was assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ({ICC}) and Bland-Altman analyses.                  Results:           Among the experts, the {CVI} indicated 94\% and 98\% of clarity and representativeness, respectively. All items were highly clear for at least 70\% of the students. Test-retest reliability was assessed with 104 students (16.3 ± 1.02 years; 66.3\% girls). The {ICC} ranged from 0.41 (95\%{CI} 0.24–0.56) for videos to 0.76 (95\%{CI} 0.66–0.83) for social media/chat applications on weekdays; and from 0.24 (95\%{CI} 0.04–0.41) for videos to 0.67 (95\%{CI} 0.54–0.77) for social media/chat applications on weekends. The lowest mean difference was -4.6 min for working on weekdays, while the highest was 40.6 min for videos on weekends.                  Conclusions:           The {QueST} proved to be fair to excellent for measuring different screen time constructs. However, the item of videos (weekends) showed poor stability.

Using a sample of 616 emerging adults in college, exploratory factor analysis was conducted with a calibration sample of 308 participants and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using an equal hold-out sample to yield a final 10-item two-factor Social Media Use Integration Scale ({SMUIS}). Strong reliability evidence was found for data collected with the total scale (α = .914), the first 6-item subscale called Social Integration and Emotional Connection ({SIEC}) (α = .893), and the second 4-item subscale entitled Integration into Social Routines ({ISR}) (α = .828). Test–retest over a 3-week period suggested that {SMUIS} responses remained stable, with reliability correlations of r = .803 for total scale, r = .804 for subscale 1, and r = .676 for subscale 2. In addition, high correlations with previously published social media use measures provided convergent validity evidence, whereas nonsignificant correlations between the {SMUIS} subscales and other measures unrelated to online social media use offered discriminant validity evidence. The {SMUIS} was first developed to measure Facebook use; however, it was purposefully designed to be adapted to measure other forms of online social media use.

Findings showed that different types of social media use very rarely yielded different effects within one and the same adolescent: 45\% of adolescents experienced no changes in well-being due to any of the three types of social media use, 28\% only experienced declines in well-being, and 26\% only experienced increases in well-being.

Together, the findings suggest that the active?passive use dichotomy in social media research is less clear-cut than it might seem.},

	abstract = {Background: Implementation outcome measures are essential for monitoring and evaluating the success of implementation efforts. Yet, currently available measures lack conceptual clarity and have largely unknown reliability and validity. This study developed and psychometrically assessed three new measures: the Acceptability of Intervention Measure ({AIM}), Intervention Appropriateness Measure ({IAM}), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure ({FIM}).
Methods: Thirty-six implementation scientists and 27 mental health professionals assigned 31 items to the constructs and rated their confidence in their assignments. The Wilcoxon one-sample signed rank test was used to assess substantive and discriminant content validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis ({EFA} and {CFA}) and Cronbach alphas were used to assess the validity of the conceptual model. Three hundred twenty-six mental health counselors read one of six randomly assigned vignettes depicting a therapist contemplating adopting an evidence-based practice ({EBP}). Participants used 15 items to rate the therapist’s perceptions of the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of adopting the {EBP}. {CFA} and Cronbach alphas were used to refine the scales, assess structural validity, and assess reliability. Analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) was used to assess known-groups validity. Finally, half of the counselors were randomly assigned to receive the same vignette and the other half the opposite vignette; and all were asked to re-rate acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess test-retest reliability and linear regression to assess sensitivity to change.
Results: All but five items exhibited substantive and discriminant content validity. A trimmed {CFA} with five items per construct exhibited acceptable model fit ({CFI} = 0.98, {RMSEA} = 0.08) and high factor loadings (0.79 to 0.94). The alphas for 5-item scales were between 0.87 and 0.89. Scale refinement based on measure-specific {CFAs} and Cronbach alphas using vignette data produced 4-item scales (α’s from 0.85 to 0.91). A three-factor {CFA} exhibited acceptable fit ({CFI} = 0.96, {RMSEA} = 0.08) and high factor loadings (0.75 to 0.89), indicating structural validity. {ANOVA} showed significant main effects, indicating known-groups validity. Test-retest reliability coefficients ranged from 0.73 to 0.88. Regression analysis indicated each measure was sensitive to change in both directions.
Conclusions: The {AIM}, {IAM}, and {FIM} demonstrate promising psychometric properties. Predictive validity assessment is planned.},

The Wheel and its accompanying assessment tool—the Motivation and Engagement Scale ({MES})—comprise eleven first‐order factors (under four higher‐order factors): self‐efficacy, valuing, and mastery orientation (adaptive cognition); planning, task management, and persistence (adaptive behaviour); anxiety, failure avoidance, and uncertain control (impeding/maladaptive cognition); and self‐handicapping and disengagement (maladaptive behaviour). We describe theoretical foundations of the {MES}, summarise corresponding forms of the {MES} for use in academic, work, sport, and music settings, and report on their psychometric properties in local and cross‐cultural settings. We then review {MES} research addressing substantive and applied issues, focusing on educational research (i.e., looking at use of the {MES} to explore the effects of gender, grade retention, delayed school entry, taking a gap year, and the role of the home on motivation and engagement). Through psychometric and substantive applications, it is proposed that this integrative approach to multidimensional motivation and engagement instrumentation has utility across diverse performance and cultural settings, educational levels, and academic subjects. As such, it can be considered a meaningful recent contribution to psycho‐educational measurement, research, theory, and practice.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Mobile phone bans in secondary schools are claimed to reduce student distraction and promote learning and face-to-face socializing. Currently, the evidence on phone bans is limited. The aim of this preregistered study was to evaluate the South Australian mobile phone ban’s effects on students’ problematic phone use, academic engagement, school belonging, and bullying. The study also sought to identify student variables that predict phone ban compliance. Methods: As the ban was phased in over 2023, a 2 (phone ban: yes/no) 3 2 (time: baseline, 1-month follow-up) repeated-measures design was employed. Students (n 5 1,282 at baseline; n 5 1,256 at follow-up) in Grades 7 to 12 were recruited from ﬁve public secondary schools. Surveys included measures drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children ({LSAC}) and the Programme for International Student Assessment ({PISA}). Results: Problematic phone use was reported by 2.6\% of the sample. Being older and a more frequent user of social media predicted lower phone ban compliance. Linear mixed models indicated that ban and no ban school groups did not differ significantly in terms of problematic phone use, academic engagement, and school belonging. There was slightly higher bullying in the ban group but bullying decreased significantly in both groups. Discussion: Imposing access restrictions may not affect the underlying psychological mechanisms that drive problematic phone use. Although these results indicate limited to no short-term beneﬁts of the ban, further evaluation with more sensitive methodologies is recommended. Conclusions: Student-technology interactions in learning institutions should be continually monitored to determine the optimal balance to support student etiquette, learning, and wellbeing.},

In a public high school sample (n ¼ 585), 24.7\% of students felt unsafe and 14.4\% avoided school due to feeling unsafe during the past month. Being female and experiencing bullying was associated with feeling unsafe. However, after accounting for demographics and bullying victimization, perceptions of safety increased when students reported positive student and teacher relations, consistent rules, a clean school that is also crowded/noisy, and a sense of school belonging. Avoiding school because of safety concerns was related to decreased school belonging and teacher/student relationships, but not bullying. Focusing on enhancing the school climate/ environment, facilitating student belongingness, and reducing bullying are ways school nurses can help promote safer schools.},

On the upside, these social resources provide a multitude of opportunities for interaction; on the downside, they often broadcast more options than can be pursued, given practical restrictions and limited time. This dual nature of social media has driven popular interest in the concept of Fear of Missing Out – popularly referred to as {FoMO}. Deﬁned as a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent, {FoMO} is characterized by the desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing. The present research presents three studies conducted to advance an empirically based understanding of the fear of missing out phenomenon. The ﬁrst study collected a diverse international sample of participants in order to create a robust individual differences measure of {FoMO}, the Fear of Missing Out scale ({FoMOs}); this study is the ﬁrst to operationalize the construct. Study 2 recruited a nationally representative cohort to investigate how demographic, motivational and well-being factors relate to {FoMO}. Study 3 examined the behavioral and emotional correlates of fear of missing out in a sample of young adults. Implications of the {FoMOs} measure and for the future study of {FoMO} are discussed.},

Although sex differences in the magnitude of these provisions were expected, it was hypothesized that the characteristics would function in a similar manner to promote friendship satisfaction. An additional goal was to provide an empirical evaluation of the relative contribution of the three types of provisions to friendship satisfaction. In Study 1, trust in male and female friends (intimacy), orientation to assistance (communal and exchange) and companionship attributes of friends were examined as elements of the individual's cognitive conceptions of friendships. The females (n = 94) reported greater trust in males, a more communal orientation to assistance and greater friendship satisfaction. Regression analyses revealed that for both males (n = 80) and females, trust in male friends contributed to friendship satisfaction while an exchange orientation detracted from it. In Study 2, Seventy-eight males and sixty females indicated the levels of self-disclosure, reciprocal exchange of assistance, enjoyment and negativity in their established friendships. Sex differences were evident in the magnitude of self-disclosure and friendship satisfaction reported by males and females. For both males and females, self-disclosure and friendship enjoyment were the significant predictors of friendship satisfaction. Overall, this research demonstrates that the characteristics associated with intimacy, namely self-disclosure and trust, and the affective tone associated with companionship are the most important contributors to friendship satisfaction for both males and females.},

	abstract = {Background: Bullying occurs in all schools. Measuring bullying in schools is complicated because both definitions of bullying and methods for measuring bullying vary. This study compared a brief 12-item Gatehouse Bullying Scale ({GBS}) with items drawn from the Peer Relations Questionnaire ({PRQ}), a well-established bullying questionnaire to measure the concurrent validity of the {GBS}. Methods: Year 8 secondary school students (14 years of age) in metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia, completed questionnaires assessing being teased, being deliberately left out, had rumors spread about oneself, and/or being physically threatened or hurt. Results: The prevalence of bullying using {GBS} and {PRQ} was 57\% and 61\%, respectively. Percent agreement between the 2 measures was high. Agreement adjusted for chance was moderate (kappa 0.5). The {GBS} had good to moderate test-retest reliability (rho 0.65). Conclusions: The {GBS} is a short, reliable tool measuring the occurrence of bullying in schools. As well as a global estimate of bullying, the {GBS} provides estimates of 2 covert and 2 overt types of bullying which can be useful for schools to better plan interventions dealing with school bullying.},

Aims This study developed and validated a survey tool that integrates measurement of both traditional and cyber bullying to test a theoretically driven multi-dimensional model. Sample Adolescents from 10 mainstream secondary schools completed a baseline and follow-up survey (N = 1,217; Mage = 14 years; 66.2\% male). Methods The Bullying and cyberbullying Scale for Adolescents ({BCS}-A) developed for this study comprised parallel victimization and perpetration subscales, each with 20 items. Additional measures of bullying (Olweus Global Bullying and the Forms of Bullying Scale [{FBS}]), as well as measures of internalizing and externalizing problems, school connectedness, social support, and personality, were used to further assess validity. Results Factor structure was determined, and then, the suitability of items was assessed according to the following criteria: (1) factor interpretability, (2) item correlations, (3) model parsimony, and (4) measurement equivalence across victimization and perpetration experiences. The final models comprised four factors: physical, verbal, relational, and cyber. The final scale was revised to two 13-item subscales. The {BCS}-A demonstrated acceptable concurrent and convergent validity (internalizing and externalizing problems, school connectedness, social support, and personality), as well as predictive validity over 6 months. Conclusions The {BCS}-A has sound psychometric properties. This tool establishes measurement equivalence across types of involvement and behavioural forms common among adolescents. An improved measurement method could add greater rigour to the evaluation of intervention programmes and also enable interventions to be tailored to subscale profiles.},

A majority of depressed patients are generally managed in the primary care setting; only a half of the cases, however, are identified at their first visit. Screening instruments to improve recognition of depression have therefore been developed. The Depression Scale ({DEPS}), consisting of 10 items, was developed and tested in primary care patients aged 18 to 64 years. Clinical assessments were made on the basis of Present State Examination interviews with 436 patients. The {DEPS} proved to be satisfactory. Increasing age and poor education had an adverse effect on the screening process, however. The sensitivity of the {DEPS} for clinical depression was 74\% and the specificity for non-depression 85\%. The sensitivity for severe depression was 84\% and the specificity for symptom-free patients 93\%. The {DEPS} seems to improve the recognition of depression in primary care and may also be suitable for screening depression in the general population and for identifying high-risk groups.},

As language models lack the ability to consume or output visual information as pixels, we use code to represent images in our study. Although {LLM}-generated images do not look like natural images, results on image generation and the ability of models to correct these generated images indicate that precise modeling of strings can teach language models about numerous aspects of the visual world. Furthermore, experiments on self-supervised visual representation learning, utilizing images generated with text models, highlight the potential to train vision models capable of making semantic assessments of natural images using just {LLMs}.},

To cope, many patients turn to socially supportive interactions and social media has become an important tool for accessing social support networks. However, research on the mental and physical health outcomes of social media-enabled social support seeking has produced conflicting results. This inconsistency in research findings has made it difficult for practitioners to make recommendations to patients on how to access online social support following negative health events. In this short commentary, I argue that effective access to stress-buffering social support online is intimately tied up in features of the social media platforms through which that support is transmitted. I propose three theory-backed distinctions between social media platforms with the goal of directing users toward effective, helpful social media engagement following negative health events.},

	abstract = {Recent research on the addictive potential of modern technologies such as the internet, smartphones, or social networking sites ({SNSs}) has suggested that emotional and motivational changes associated with the sudden discontinuation of engagement with the technology mirror the aversive consequences seen when drug use is ceased abruptly. This has been observed even in moderate users and interpreted as a manifestation of withdrawal, an important marker of physical dependence in substance use disorders. On the other hand, a growing literature emphasises the positive effects of "digital detox" on mental health and well-being. Using a battery of affective and motivational measures, both explicit and implicit, the present study tracked the effects of a week of significantly reduced {SNS} use in moderate to heavy {SNS} users (N = 51). Our pre-registered analyses showed that the intervention elicited affective changes neither consistent with a general withdrawal syndrome (i.e., increased negative affect and cravings) nor with a general beneficial effect on well-being: While our data indicated some abstinence-related decreases of negative affect and boredom, they also showed a reduction of positive affect. These changes occurred regardless of problematic/addictive use behaviours. Importantly, restricting {SNS} use for one week had no effect on implicit measures of {SNS} use motivation (i.e., approach biases, time distortion and effort expenditure for {SNS} access) nor did it influence explicit cravings and {SNS} cue-reactivity. Together our findings suggest that restricting {SNS} use has nuanced and potentially offsetting effects on well-being. These could arise because use reduction may concurrently remove experiences that trigger negative emotions (e.g., upward social comparisons or Fear of Missing Out) but also those that elicit positive emotions (e.g., social approval). The hypothesised lack of a net effect on well-being would be consistent with our finding that voluntary reduction of {SNS} use does not mitigate or exacerbate {SNS}-related urges.},

By being fun, games allow researchers to study new questions in cognition such as the meaning of ‘play’ and intrinsic motivation, while also supporting more extensive and diverse data collection by attracting many more participants. We describe the advantages and drawbacks of using games relative to standard laboratory-based experiments and lay out a set of recommendations on how to gain the most from using games to study cognition.

	abstract = {In the field of natural language processing, the rapid development of large language model ({LLM}) has attracted more and more attention. {LLMs} have shown a high level of creativity in various tasks, but the methods for assessing such creativity are inadequate. The assessment of {LLM} creativity needs to consider differences from humans, requiring multi-dimensional measurement while balancing accuracy and efficiency. This paper aims to establish an efficient framework for assessing the level of creativity in {LLMs}. By adapting the modified Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, the research evaluates the creative performance of various {LLMs} across 7 tasks, emphasizing 4 criteria including Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. In this context, we develop a comprehensive dataset of 700 questions for testing and an {LLM}-based evaluation method. In addition, this study presents a novel analysis of {LLMs}' responses to diverse prompts and role-play situations. We found that the creativity of {LLMs} primarily falls short in originality, while excelling in elaboration. Besides, the use of prompts and the role-play settings of the model significantly influence creativity. Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that collaboration among multiple {LLMs} can enhance originality. Notably, our findings reveal a consensus between human evaluations and {LLMs} regarding the personality traits that influence creativity. The findings underscore the significant impact of {LLM} design on creativity and bridges artificial intelligence and human creativity, offering insights into {LLMs}' creativity and potential applications.},

Results indicated that {ChatGPT} scored within the top 1\% for originality and ﬂuency, and showed high scores for ﬂexibility, thus highlighting the current creative abilities of {AI} and the potential of {AI} systems to support and augment human creativity in new and meaningful ways. The study encourages additional research to further deﬁne, measure, and develop creativity in the era of advanced {AI}.},

Indeed, score-based diffusion models can generate highly creative images that lie far from their training data. But optimal score-matching theory suggests that these models should only be able to produce memorized training examples. To reconcile this theory-experiment gap, we identify two simple inductive biases, locality and equivariance, that: (1) induce a form of combinatorial creativity by preventing optimal score-matching; (2) result in a fully analytic, completely mechanistically interpretable, equivariant local score ({ELS}) machine that, (3) without any training can quantitatively predict the outputs of trained convolution only diffusion models (like {ResNets} and {UNets}) with high accuracy (median {\textbackslash}rˆ2{\textbackslash} of {\textbackslash}0.90, 0.91, 0.94{\textbackslash} on {CIFAR}10, {FashionMNIST}, and {MNIST}). Our {ELS} machine reveals a locally consistent patch mosaic model of creativity, in which diffusion models create exponentially many novel images by mixing and matching different local training set patches in different image locations. Our theory also partially predicts the outputs of pre-trained self-attention enabled {UNets} (median {\textbackslash}rˆ2 {\textbackslash}textbackslashsim 0.75{\textbackslash} on {CIFAR}10), revealing an intriguing role for attention in carving out semantic coherence from local patch mosaics.},

	abstract = {In the era of extensive intersection between art and Artificial Intelligence ({AI}), such as image generation and fiction co-creation, {AI} for music remains relatively nascent, particularly in music understanding. This is evident in the limited work on deep music representations, the scarcity of large-scale datasets, and the absence of a universal and community-driven benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce the Music Audio Representation Benchmark for {universaL} Evaluation, termed {MARBLE}. It aims to provide a benchmark for various Music Information Retrieval ({MIR}) tasks by defining a comprehensive taxonomy with four hierarchy levels, including acoustic, performance, score, and high-level description. We establish a unified protocol based on 18 tasks on 12 public-available datasets, providing a fair and standard assessment of representations of all open-sourced pre-trained models developed on music recordings as baselines. {MARBLE} offers an easy-to-use, extendable, and reproducible suite for the community, with clear statements on dataset copyright. Results suggest that recently proposed large-scale pre-trained musical language models perform the best in most tasks, with room for further improvement. The leaderboard and toolkit repository are published34 to promote future music {AI} research.},

We then present our collection to both {LLMs} and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. {MACGYVER} is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. In contrast, {LLMs}, exposed to a variety of specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing physicallyinfeasible actions. This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking, which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2) provides insight into the constrained problemsolving capabilities of both humans and {AI}.},

First, we found that, on average, human-{AI} combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or {AI} alone. Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed {AI} alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when the {AI} outperformed humans alone we found losses.

	abstract = {Creative problem-solving is a naturalistic form of creative thinking involving the generation of solutions that are not only original but also of high quality (i.e., plausible and effective). Naturalistic tasks that evaluate both originality and quality are vital for the promotion of creativity in real-world settings—yet scoring such tasks remains challenging, due to costly human labor required to manually rate task responses. Past work has shown that large language models ({LLMs}) can be trained to predict human originality ratings of responses to tests of divergent thinking. In the present research, we extend this work to creative problem-solving, examining whether both originality and quality can be automatically scored for a naturalistic creativity task. We gathered data from 10 studies, amounting to 3,235 participants who completed a creative problem-solving task ({CPST}). We then fine-tuned two open-source {LLMs}, {RoBERTa} and {GPT}-2, to predict human ratings of originality and quality on the {CPST}, and compared their performance to two other scoring methods: elaboration (i.e., word count) and semantic distance. We found that {RoBERTa} and {GPT}-2 models predict solution quality ({RoBERTa}, r = .83; {GPT}-2, r = .83) better than solution originality ({RoBERTa}, r = .79; {GPT}-2, r = .80). Moreover, we found that both models outperformed elaboration and semantic distance methods and generalized to new {CPST} items not present in their training set. We therefore show for the first time that naturalistic creativity tasks can be automatically scored for both originality and quality. Open access is provided to the models and training data.},

However, research on {LLM} creativity has focused solely on {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextit\{products\}, with little attention on the creative {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextit\{process\}. Process analyses of human creativity often require hand-coded categories or exploit response times, which do not apply to {LLMs}. We provide an automated method to characterise how humans and {LLMs} explore semantic spaces on the Alternate Uses Task, and contrast with behaviour in a Verbal Fluency Task. We use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic similarities, which we use to generate jump profiles. Our results corroborate earlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic spaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to creativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores. {LLMs} were found to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied across tasks. Though {LLMs} as a population match human profiles, their relationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score higher on creativity.

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) are applied to all sorts of creative tasks, and their outputs vary from beautiful, to peculiar, to pastiche, into plain plagiarism. The temperature parameter of an {LLM} regulates the amount of randomness, leading to more diverse outputs; therefore, it is often claimed to be the creativity parameter. Here, we investigate this claim using a narrative generation task with a predetermined fixed context, model and prompt. Specifically, we present an empirical analysis of the {LLM} output for different temperature values using four necessary conditions for creativity in narrative generation: novelty, typicality, cohesion, and coherence. We find that temperature is weakly correlated with novelty, and unsurprisingly, moderately correlated with incoherence, but there is no relationship with either cohesion or typicality. However, the influence of temperature on creativity is far more nuanced and weak than suggested by the "creativity parameter" claim; overall results suggest that the {LLM} generates slightly more novel outputs as temperatures get higher. Finally, we discuss ideas to allow more controlled {LLM} creativity, rather than relying on chance via changing the temperature parameter.},

	abstract = {Researchers have argued that large language models ({LLMs}) exhibit high-quality writing capabilities from blogs to stories. However, evaluating objectively the creativity of a piece of writing is challenging. Inspired by the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking ({TTCT}), which measures creativity as a process, we use the Consensual Assessment Technique [3] and propose the Torrance Test of Creative Writing ({TTCW}) to evaluate creativity as a product. {TTCW} consists of 14 binary tests organized into the original dimensions of Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. We recruit 10 creative writers and implement a human assessment of 48 stories written either by professional authors or {LLMs} using {TTCW}. Our analysis shows that {LLM}-generated stories pass 3-10X less {TTCW} tests than stories written by professionals. In addition, we explore the use of {LLMs} as assessors to automate the {TTCW} evaluation, revealing that none of the {LLMs} positively correlate with the expert assessments.},

	abstract = {Large language models ({LLMs}) have shown exceptional proficiency in natural language processing but often fall short of generating creative and original responses to open-ended questions. To enhance {LLM} creativity, our key insight is to emulate the human process of inducing collective creativity through engaging discussions with participants from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. To this end, we propose {LLM} Discussion, a three-phase discussion framework that facilitates vigorous and diverging idea exchanges and ensures convergence to creative answers. Moreover, we adopt a role-playing technique by assigning distinct roles to {LLMs} to combat the homogeneity of {LLMs}. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework with the Alternative Uses Test, Similarities Test, Instances Test, and Scientific Creativity Test through both {LLM} evaluation and human study. The results show that our proposed framework outperforms single-{LLM} approaches and existing multi-{LLM} frameworks across various creativity metrics.

In attempting to provide an answer, further questions about the creativity and intentionality exhibited by {AI} will emerge. In the first part of the paper I propose to replace the question of whether a computer can be creative with questions over the intentionality displayed by the system. The notion of creativity is indeed embedded with our subjective judgement and this prevents us from giving an objective evaluation of an idea or product as creative. In Sect. 2, I suggest to shift the focus of the inquiry to the autonomy possessed by the software. I finally argue that the application of generative adversarial networks to music generators provides the software with a level of autonomy sufficient to deem it able to create musical works.},

The current studies sought to investigate how observers respond to works of visual art created either by humans or by computers. Study 1 tested observers’ ability to discriminate between computer-generated and man-made art, and then examined how categorization of art works impacted on perceived aesthetic value, revealing a bias against computer-generated art. In Study 2 this bias was reproduced in the context of robotic art; however, it was found to be reversed when observers were given the opportunity to see robotic artists in action. These findings reveal an explicit prejudice against computer-generated art, driven largely by the kind of art observers believe computer algorithms are capable of producing. These prejudices can be overridden in circumstances in which observers are able to infer anthropomorphic characteristics in the computer programs, a finding which has implications for the future of artistic {AI}.},

Examination of 99 symphonies by 13 symphonists between Beethoven and Shostakovich showed that such rudimentary programmatic data can predict several subjective and objective features, including aesthetic significance, listener accessibility, repertoire popularity, melodic originality, originality variation, and playing time. Discussion follows about what these empirical relationships may imply about how composers create their symphonies and how appreciators perceive those musical products.},

In Experiment 1, a sphere moved towards another sphere that started to move before the contact (social causality); in Experiment 2, a sphere moved towards another sphere that started to move after the contact (physical causality); in Experiment 3, a sphere moved towards fixed objects (physical causality). In the two test trials, either the intervening or the non-intervening agent needed help to enter into a box, and the bystander helped either agent. Later, a manual choice task assessed infants’ preferences. The results demon­ strated that only in the social condition infants expected a bystander to help an intervening agent, and preferred the intervening agent. The findings provided evidence that infants’ evaluations are triggered by the perception of social causality.},

However, the question of whether titles and artist names affect listeners when evaluating music has not yet been investigated. By using two well-known cognitive heuristics, we investigated whether names presented with music pieces influenced aesthetic and value judgements of music. Experiment 1 (N= 48) focused on linguistic fluency. The same music excerpts were presented with easy-topronounce (fluent) and difficult-to-pronounce (disfluent) names. Experiment 2 (N= 100) studied the affect heuristic. The same music excerpts were presented with positive (e.g., Kiss), negative (e.g., Suicide), and neutral (e.g., Window) titles. In both studies, aesthetic and value judgements of music were significantly influenced by the linguistic manipulation of the names. Participants in Experiment 1 evaluated the same music more positively when presented with fluent names compared to disfluent names. In Experiment 2, presenting the music with negative titles resulted in the lowest judgements. Moreover, music excerpts presented with neutral and negative titles were remembered significantly more often than positive titles. Finally, a comparison of the music presented with and without titles indicated that music excerpts were more liked in the presence of titles than in their absence. The present research shows different ways in which aesthetic and value judgements can be influenced by names presented with music. Results suggest that like any other human judgement, evaluations of music also rely on heuristic principles that do not necessarily depend on the aesthetic stimuli themselves.},

	abstract = {Cognitive approaches have recently been proposed for understanding art appreciation, emphasizing the role of perceived artist’s intentions and messages in how lay people define what is “art” and what is “good” art. In particular, it is argued that a work of art automatically triggers speculation about the artist’s intention, and that it is intuitively assessed as an act of symbolic communication. The current experimental study tested these claims by presenting participants with various artifacts and works of art, alongside differing levels of information regarding the artist’s intentions, and asking them to rate the artifacts on artistic merit. In total, 505 adults participated in four experiments. In experiment 1, participants used the artists’ putative intentions to decide whether certain artifacts were instances of “art.” In experiments 2a and 2b, titles that ostensibly clarified the artists’ messages were found to increase participants’ understanding and, importantly, liking of a series of works of art. In experiment 3, high levels of perceived investment from artists were found to increase how much participants liked a series of paintings. Overall, the results suggest that perceived artists’ intentions and messages affect what people consider to be art and good art. The art experience is not only about beauty or hedonistic pleasure, but involves assessment of the artist’s intention and of the history behind the work of art.},

To date there is no evidence on whether human products, which signal the workings of a mind in the absence of an explicit agent, also reliably engage neural structures typically associated with mental state attribution. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging the present study shows that when subjects believe they are listening to a piece of music that was written by a composer (i.e., human product) as opposed to generated by a computer (i.e., nonhuman product), activations in the cortical network typically reported for mental state attribution (anterior medial frontal cortex [{aMFC}]), superior temporal sulcus, and temporal poles) were observed. The activation in the {aMFC} correlated highly with the extent to which subjects had engaged in attributing the expression of intentions to the composed pieces, as indicated in a postimaging questionnaire. We interpret these ﬁndings as indicative of automatic mechanisms, which reﬂect mental state attribution in the face of any stimulus that potentially signals the working of another mind and conclude that even in the absence of a socially salient stimulus, our environment is still populated by the indirect social signals inherent to human artifacts.},

In this study, we explore a notion of rationality based on the idea of evolutionary ﬁtness. We ask whether agents that are more adapted to their environment are, consequently, perceived as more rational and intentional. We created a 2-D virtual environment populated with autonomous virtual agents, each of which behaves according to a built-in program equipped with simulated perception, memory, and decision making. We then introduced a process of simulated evolution that pressured the agents’ programs toward behavior more adapted to the simulated environment. We showed these agents to human subjects in 2 experiments, in which we respectively asked them to judge their intelligence and to dynamically estimate their “mental states.” The results conﬁrm that subjects construed evolved agents as more intelligent, and judged evolved agents’ mental states more accurately, relative to nonevolved agents. These results corroborate a view that the interpretation of agent behavior is connected to a concept of rationality based on the apparent ﬁt between an agent’s actions and its environment.},

Toward this end, two experiments investigated factors contributing to listeners’ narrative engagement with music, comparing the narrative experiences of Western and Chinese instrumental music for listeners in two suburban locations in the United States with those of listeners living in a remote rural village in China with different patterns of musical exposure. Supporting an enculturation perspective where learned extramusical associations (i.e., Topicality) play an important role in narrative perceptions of music, results from the first experiment show that for Western listeners, greater Topicality, rather than greater Contrast, increases narrative engagement, as long as listeners have sufficient exposure to its patterns of use within a culture. Strengthening this interpretation, results for the second experiment, which directly manipulated Topicality and Contrast, show that reducing an excerpt’s Topicality, but not its Contrast reduces listeners’ narrative engagement.},

	abstract = {The commonly used paradigm to investigate Dennet's ‘intentional stance’ compares neural activation when participants compete with a human versus a computer. This paradigm confounds whether the opponent is natural or artificial and whether it is intentional or an automaton. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study is, to our knowledge, the first to investigate the intentional stance by orthogonally varying perceptions of the opponents' intentionality (responding actively or passively according to a script) and embodiment (human or a computer). The mere perception of the opponent (whether human or computer) as intentional activated the mentalizing network: the temporoparietal junction ({TPJ}) bilaterally, right temporal pole, anterior paracingulate cortex ({aPCC}) and the precuneus. Interacting with humans versus computers induced activations in a more circumscribed right lateralized subnetwork within the mentalizing network, consisting of the {TPJ} and the {aPCC}, possibly reflective of the tendency to spontaneously attribute intentionality to humans. The interaction between intentionality (active versus passive) and opponent (human versus computer) recruited the left frontal pole, possibly in response to violations of the default intentional stance towards humans and computers. Employing an orthogonal design is important to adequately capture Dennett's conception of the intentional stance as a mentalizing strategy that can apply equally well to humans and other intentional agents.},

	shorttitle = {Training away bias},
	abstract = {A pressing issue concerns how to reduce stereotypic responses and discriminatory outcomes resulting from the operation of implicit biases. One possibility is that cognitive retraining, such as by repeatedly practicing counterstereotypes, can reduce implicit bias so that stereotype application will be reduced in turn. Another possibility involves motivated self-regulation, where people's awareness of their proneness to biased responses heightens negative self-directed affect, which in turn facilitates monitoring for biases and reduces stereotype application. These possibilities were tested across three experiments. In all experiments, participants who completed counterstereotype training subsequently scored lower on a measure of implicit bias, relative to untrained participants. In Experiments 1 and 2, counterstereotyping did not reduce subsequent stereotype application; in Experiment 3, counterstereotyping did reduce stereotype application, but this effect was not mediated by implicit bias scores. Participants in the motivated self-regulation condition (Experiments 2 \& 3) were primed with their proneness to respond in biased ways, which increased negative self-directed affect among participants more internally motivated to respond without bias. Participants' degree of negative self-directed affect was not consistently associated with implicit bias scores. However, greater negative self-directed affect was associated with reduced stereotype application (Experiment 2) and greater rejection of racist jokes (Experiment 3). These results suggest that reductions of implicit bias through counterstereotype training do not, in turn, lead to reduced stereotype application. In contrast, the results support the viability of motivated self-regulation interventions that facilitate awareness of bias and heighten negative self-directed affect, thus creating the motivation to self-regulate stereotype application.

	abstract = {Three studies introduced the construct of bias awareness and examined its effect on Whites' responses to evidence of personal and others' racial biases. Contemporary theories of prejudice suggest that awareness of personal bias is a critical step in reducing one's prejudice and discrimination. When bias is a cloaked in a way that people do not recognize, they are likely to continue to perpetuate their biased behaviors and unlikely to reduce their negative attitudes. However, when people become aware of their biases, they often adjust their attitudes and behavior to be more egalitarian. The present research investigated (a) individual differences in Whites' awareness of their propensity to express subtly biased behavior against Blacks in interracial contexts (Study 1), (b) the convergent and discriminant validity of a new individual difference measure of bias awareness (Studies 1, 2, and 3), (c) whether this measure uniquely predicts Whites' responses to a difficult race-related context—receiving feedback that they are high in implicit bias from an Implicit Association Test (R-{IAT}; Study 2), and (d) whether this measure uniquely predicts Whites' perceptions of others' racial bias, particularly subtle expressions (Study 3). Results revealed that the Bias Awareness Scale measures a distinct construct that uniquely predicts Whites' emotional and behavioral responses to information about their own bias, and their ability to detect bias in others.

Results revealed that stereotype endorsement scores in the various reporting conditions were moderated by participants' source of motivation to respond without prejudice. The findings are consistent with the argument that responses under bogus pipeline conditions assess people's awareness of their experience of bias, whereas private reports assess people's personal beliefs about the appropriateness of the stereotype of Black people.

Despite such a large body of work, we lack a broad conceptual understanding of when combinations of humans and {AI} are better than either alone. Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems {eLibrary}) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, {AI} alone and human–{AI} combinations. First, we found that, on average, human–{AI} combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or {AI} alone (Hedges’ g = −0.23; 95\% confidence interval, −0.39 to −0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed {AI} alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when {AI} outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human–{AI} collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human–{AI} systems.},

To this end, we create {MACGYVER}, an automatically generated dataset consisting of over 1,600 real-world problems deliberately designed to trigger innovative usage of objects and necessitate out-of-the-box thinking. We then present our collection to both {LLMs} and humans to compare and contrast their problem-solving abilities. {MACGYVER} is challenging for both groups, but in unique and complementary ways. For instance, humans excel in tasks they are familiar with but struggle with domain-specific knowledge, leading to a higher variance. In contrast, {LLMs}, exposed to a variety of specialized knowledge, attempt broader problems but fail by proposing physically-infeasible actions. Finally, we provide a detailed error analysis of {LLMs}, and demonstrate the potential of enhancing their problem-solving ability with novel prompting techniques such as iterative step-wise reflection and divergent-convergent thinking. This work (1) introduces a fresh arena for intelligent agents focusing on intricate aspects of physical reasoning, planning, and unconventional thinking, which supplements the existing spectrum of machine intelligence; and (2) provides insight into the constrained problem-solving capabilities of both humans and {AI}.},

Recently, deep learning methods have emerged as a solution to the task of automatic music generation ({AMG}) using symbolic tokens in a target style, but their superiority over non-deep learning methods has not been demonstrated. Here, we conduct a listening study to comparatively evaluate several music generation systems along six musical dimensions: stylistic success, aesthetic pleasure, repetition or self-reference, melody, harmony, and rhythm. A range of models, both deep learning algorithms and other methods, are used to generate 30-s excerpts in the style of Classical string quartets and classical piano improvisations. Fifty participants with relatively high musical knowledge rate unlabelled samples of computer-generated and human-composed excerpts for the six musical dimensions. We use non-parametric Bayesian hypothesis testing to interpret the results, allowing the possibility of finding meaningful non-differences between systems’ performance. We find that the strongest deep learning method, a reimplemented version of Music Transformer, has equivalent performance to a non-deep learning method, {MAIA} Markov, demonstrating that to date, deep learning does not outperform other methods for {AMG}. We also find there still remains a significant gap between any algorithmic method and humancomposed excerpts.},

While idea evaluation is likely involved, the emphasis is strongly on idea generation. Here, we test the value of presenting a word overlapping an image compared to a word only prompt, and we introduce a cyclic adaptation of the {AUT} explicitly calling on participants to choose their best idea. In Experiment 1, as compared to word only, word + image prompts increased idea fluency but reduced idea originality and variability within a group of native Polish speakers. Thus, word + image prompts improve {AUT} baselining. In Experiment 2, different participants produced as many ideas as possible within two minutes (List) or their single best idea at the end of each of three 30 s ideation cycles (Cycle). Although originality did not differ between List and Cycle overall, the first three ideas in List were rated as less creative than the ideas in Cycle. Overall, we conclude that using disambiguating images reduces spurious interindividual variability in the {AUT} while introducing idea evaluation in the task allows us to assess creativity beyond idea generation.},

The literature suggests that creativity results from the optimal balance between novelty and familiarity, which can be measured based on the combinations of words in an idea. We build semantic networks where nodes represent word stems in a particular idea generation topic, and edge weights capture the degree of novelty versus familiarity of word stem combinations (i.e., the weight of an edge that connects two word stems measures their scaled co-occurrence in the relevant language). Each idea contains a set of word stems, which form a semantic subnetwork. The edge weight distribution in that subnetwork reﬂects how the idea balances novelty with familiarity. Based on the “beauty in averageness” eﬀect, we hypothesize that ideas with semantic subnetworks that have a more prototypical edge weight distribution are judged as more creative. We show this eﬀect in eight studies involving over 4,000 ideas across multiple domains. Practically, we demonstrate how our research can be used to automatically identify promising ideas and recommend words to users on the ﬂy to help them improve their ideas.},

We find that {GPT}4 outperforms humans in both types of creativity. Finally, we show that using {GPT}4 to simply re-write ideas originally written by humans results in those ideas being rated as significantly more creative and that the improvement is explained by creativity in form.

Two case studies of artificial cognitive systems evaluated with human creativity tests are reviewed. A general approach is put forward. The applicability of this general approach to other creativity tests and artificial cognitive systems, together with ways of performing cognitive knowledge acquisition for these systems are then explored.},

Here, we examine the development of creativity using a “creative foraging” task. The task measures different facets of creativity which we compare between 4- to 8-year-old children and adults. We find that compared to adults, children spend a higher percentage of their search exploring, and their exploitation phases are less efficient. Moreover, children orient their search to a different and smaller region of the search space, but within that space they produce more unique creative products. Lastly, as children grow up, their creative products become more adult-like and their uniqueness decreases. Together, these results suggest that creative search changes across development, in the search strategy employed, in how the space of possibilities is navigated, and in what ideas are ultimately chosen.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality ({VR}) is considered a compelling tool to foster creativity by allowing its users to create in 3D space. However, the challenge lies in understanding how people use these tools and what they create, hindering the drawing of meaningful conclusions about {VR} as a viable tool for creativity. Furthermore, past research has shown that contextual factors shape how people create within {VR}, suggesting the existence of other factors. Here, we analyze the 3D creations of 137 participants responding to different creativity activities across seven sessions on a social {VR} platform. Specifically, we evaluate the role of virtual mobility, the capacity to move freely or have restricted movement in virtual space. We additionally present a {VR}-specific creativity coding scheme that follows recommendations from previous literature. Using dimensions derived from this coding scheme, we examine how these dimensions relate to behaviors and features of the creations in the context of virtual mobility. Results showed the significant role of virtual mobility on the design process, such that participants iterated and revised more by deleting more when their avatars were allowed to teleport and translate freely, compared to when their avatar’s movements were restricted to sitting down in virtual chairs. Furthermore, participants built shorter creations and took up less projection space with restricted virtual mobility. Results also showed that participants created more practical, unique, and well-implemented creations the more 3D models they used. Similarly, the more participants deleted, the more well-implemented the creations were. We discuss implications for designers of creation-oriented {VR} platforms and pedagogy for instructors facilitating activities in educational contexts.},

Our work serves as a first step in determining which particular representations and competences, as well as which kinds of knowledge or skill, can be derived from particular learning techniques and data.

	abstract = {Despite six decades of creative cognition research, measures of creative ideation have heavily relied on divergent thinking tasks, which still suffer from conceptual, design, and psychometric shortcomings. These shortcomings have greatly impeded the accurate study of creative ideation, its dynamics, development, and integration as part of a comprehensive psychological assessment. After a brief overview of the historical and current anchoring of creative ideation measurement, overlooked challenges in its most common operationalization (i.e., divergent thinking tasks framework) are discussed. They include (1) the reliance on a single stimulus as a starting point of the creative ideation process (stimulus-dependency), (2) the analysis of response quality based on a varying number of observations across test-takers (ﬂuency-dependency), and (3) the production of “static” cumulative performance indicators. Inspired from an emerging line of work from the ﬁeld of cognitive neuroscience of creativity, this paper introduces a new assessment framework referred to as “Multi-Trial Creative Ideation” ({MTCI}). This framework shifts the current measurement paradigm by (1) offering a variety of stimuli presented in a well-deﬁned set of ideation “trials,” (2) reinterprets the concept of ideational ﬂuency using a time-analysis of idea generation, and (3) captures individual dynamics in the ideation process (e.g., modeling the effort-time required to reach a response of maximal uncommonness) while controlling for stimulus-speciﬁc sources of variation. Advantages of the {MTCI} framework over the classic divergent thinking paradigm are discussed in light of current directions in the ﬁeld of creativity research.},

	abstract = {Selective reporting of results based on their statistical significance threatens the validity of meta-analytic findings. A variety of techniques for detecting selective reporting, publication bias, or small-study effects are available and are routinely used in research syntheses. Most such techniques are univariate, in that they assume that each study contributes a single, independent effect size estimate to the meta-analysis. In practice, however, studies often contribute multiple, statistically dependent effect size estimates, such as for multiple measures of a common outcome construct. Many methods are available for meta-analyzing dependent effect sizes, but methods for investigating selective reporting while also handling effect size dependencies require further investigation. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate three available univariate tests for small-study effects or selective reporting, including the trim and fill test, Egger’s regression test, and a likelihood ratio test from a three-parameter selection model (3PSM), when dependence is ignored or handled using ad hoc techniques. We also examine two variants of Egger’s regression test that incorporate robust variance estimation ({RVE}) or multilevel meta-analysis ({MLMA}) to handle dependence. Simulation results demonstrate that ignoring dependence inflates Type I error rates for all univariate tests. Variants of Egger’s regression maintain Type I error rates when dependent effect sizes are sampled or handled using {RVE} or {MLMA}. The 3PSM likelihood ratio test does not fully control Type I error rates. With the exception of the 3PSM, all methods have limited power to detect selection bias except under strong selection for statistically significant effects.

We introduce the Theory of Mind module that scaffolds the high-level planning process by generating hypotheses about other agents' strategies in natural language. It then evaluates and iteratively refines these hypotheses by reinforcing hypotheses that make correct predictions about the other agents' behavior. Hypothetical Minds significantly improves performance over previous {LLM}-agent and {RL} baselines on a range of competitive, mixed motive, and collaborative domains in the Melting Pot benchmark, including both dyadic and population-based environments. Additionally, comparisons against {LLM}-agent baselines and ablations reveal the importance of hypothesis evaluation and refinement for succeeding on complex scenarios.},

After critically reviewing the notion of accuracy in creativity judgments, this article explores whether (1) people in general are discerning and (2) whether some people are more discerning than others. University students (n = 226) completed four divergent thinking tasks and then decided which responses were their most creative. Judges then rated the creativity of all of the responses. Multilevel latent-variable models found that people's choices strongly agreed with judges' ratings of the responses; overall, people were discerning in their decisions. But some people were more discerning than others: people high in openness to experience, in particular, had stronger agreement between their decisions and the judges' ratings. Creative people are thus doubly skilled: they are better at generating good ideas and at picking their best ideas. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

U.S. American adults completed two tasks designed to measure creativity. Before each creativity trial, participants completed an unrelated search of a city map. Between subjects, we manipulated the search pattern, with some participants seeking multiple, dispersed spatial locations and others repeatedly converging on the same location. Participants who searched divergently in space were better at divergent thinking but worse at convergent thinking; this pattern reversed for participants who had converged repeatedly on a single location.

We propose that visual systems are space-time fitters, meaning visual development can be understood as a blind fitting process (akin to evolution) in which visual systems gradually adapt to the spatiotemporal data distributions in the newborn’s environment. To test whether space-time fitting is a viable theory for learning how to see, we performed parallel controlled-rearing experiments on newborn chicks and deep neural networks ({DNNs}), including {CNNs} and transformers. First, we raised newborn chicks in impoverished environments containing a single object, then simulated those environments in a video game engine. Second, we recorded first-person images from agents moving through the virtual animal chambers and used those images to train {DNNs}. Third, we compared the viewpoint-invariant object recognition performance of the chicks and {DNNs}. When {DNNs} received the same visual diet (training data) as chicks, the models developed common object recognition skills as chicks. {DNNs} that used time as a teaching signal—space-time fitters—also showed common patterns of successes and failures across the test viewpoints as chicks. Thus, {DNNs} can learn object recognition in the same impoverished environments as newborn animals. We argue that space-time fitters can serve as formal scientific models of newborn visual systems, providing image-computable models for studying how newborns learn to see from raw visual experiences.},

	abstract = {Abstract reasoning is a key ability for an intelligent system. Large language models ({LMs}) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. Human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable “content effects”; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns are central to debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models—whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge—similarly mix content into their answers to logic problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art {LMs}, as well as humans, and find that the {LMs} reflect many of the same qualitative human patterns on these tasks—like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected in accuracy patterns, and in some lower-level features like the relationship between {LM} confidence over possible answers and human response times. However, in some cases the humans and models behave differently—particularly on the Wason task, where humans perform much worse than large models, and exhibit a distinct error pattern. Our findings have implications for understanding possible contributors to these human cognitive effects, as well as the factors that influence language model performance.},

Currently, the evidence on phone bans is limited. The aim of this preregistered study was to evaluate the South Australian mobile phone ban's effects on students' problematic phone use, academic engagement, school belonging, and bullying. The study also sought to identify student variables that predict phone ban compliance. Methods As the ban was phased in over 2023, a 2 (phone ban: yes/no) × 2 (time: baseline, 1-month follow-up) repeated-measures design was employed. Students (n = 1,282 at baseline; n = 1,256 at follow-up) in Grades 7 to 12 were recruited from five public secondary schools. Surveys included measures drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children ({LSAC}) and the Programme for International Student Assessment ({PISA}). Results Problematic phone use was reported by 2.6\% of the sample. Being older and a more frequent user of social media predicted lower phone ban compliance. Linear mixed models indicated that ban and no ban school groups did not differ significantly in terms of problematic phone use, academic engagement, and school belonging. There was slightly higher bullying in the ban group but bullying decreased significantly in both groups. Discussion Imposing access restrictions may not affect the underlying psychological mechanisms that drive problematic phone use. Although these results indicate limited to no short-term benefits of the ban, further evaluation with more sensitive methodologies is recommended. Conclusions Student-technology interactions in learning institutions should be continually monitored to determine the optimal balance to support student etiquette, learning, and wellbeing.},

We find that student performance in high stakes exams significantly increases post ban, by about 0.07 standard deviations on average. These increases in performance are driven by the lowest-achieving students. This suggests that the unstructured presence of phones has detrimental effects on certain students and restricting their use can be a low-cost policy to reduce educational inequalities.},

We varied the number of {AI}-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as '{AI}' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design – ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition – speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having {LLMs} 'in the culture loop'. We find that high {AI} exposure (but not low {AI} exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. {AI} made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from {AI} and that participants may knowingly adopt {AI} ideas when the task is difficult.

It is suggested that these cultural practices have resulted in apathy and stagnation in Western culture.

	abstract = {Making online social communities ‘better’ is a challenging undertaking, as online communities are extraordinarily varied in their size, topical focus, and governance. As such, what is valued by one community may not be valued by another. In this work, we measure community values through a survey of 2,769 reddit users in 2,151 unique subreddits, the largest survey of community values to date. Through a combination of survey responses and a quantitative analysis of publicly available reddit data, we characterize how these values vary within and across communities. We find that there is 47.4\% more disagreement over how safe communities are than disagreement over other aspects of communities’ current state, that longstanding communities place 30.1\% more emphasis on trustworthiness than newer communities, and that recently joined redditors perceive their communities more positively than more senior redditors. We find that community moderators want their communities to be 56.7\% less democratic than non-moderator community members. Accurate and scalable modeling of community values enables research and governance which is tuned to each community’s different values. To this end, we demonstrate that a small number of automatically quantifiable features captures a substantial amount of the variation in values between communities with a {ROC} {AUC} of 0.667 on a binary classification task. However, significant variation remains, and modeling community values remains an important topic for future work. We make our models and data public to inform community design and governance.},

	abstract = {Widespread concerns about new technologies?whether they be novels, radios, or smartphones?are repeatedly found throughout history. Although tales of past panics are often met with amusement today, current concerns routinely engender large research investments and policy debate. What we learn from studying past technological panics, however, is that these investments are often inefficient and ineffective. What causes technological panics to repeatedly reincarnate? And why does research routinely fail to address them? To answer such questions, I examined the network of political, population, and academic factors driving the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics. In this cycle, psychologists are encouraged to spend time investigating new technologies, and how they affect children and young people, to calm a worried population. Their endeavor, however, is rendered ineffective because of the lack of a theoretical baseline; researchers cannot build on what has been learned researching past technologies of concern. Thus, academic study seemingly restarts for each new technology of interest, which slows down the policy interventions necessary to ensure technologies are benefiting society. In this article, I highlight how the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics stymies psychology?s positive role in steering technological change and the pervasive need for improved research and policy approaches to new technologies.},

	abstract = {The rise of Generative {AI} ({GenAI}) in knowledge workflows raises questions about its impact on critical thinking skills and practices. We survey 319 knowledge workers to investigate 1) when and how they perceive the enaction of critical thinking when using {GenAI}, and 2) when and why {GenAI} affects their effort to do so. Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using {GenAI} in work tasks. Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specific factors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence in {GenAI} are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted and the effort of doing so in {GenAI}-assisted tasks. Specifically, higher confidence in {GenAI} is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking. Qualitatively, {GenAI} shifts the nature of critical thinking toward information verification, response integration, and task stewardship. Our insights reveal new design challenges and opportunities for developing {GenAI} tools for knowledge work.},

However, loneliness is likely to be an important aspect of aging. A major limiting factor in studying loneliness has been the lack of a measure suitable for large-scale social surveys. This article describes a short loneliness scale developed specifically for use on a telephone survey. The scale has three items and a simplified set of response categories but appears to measure overall loneliness quite well. The authors also document the relationship between loneliness and several commonly used measures of objective social isolation. As expected, they find that objective and subjective isolation are related. However, the relationship is relatively modest, indicating that the quantitative and qualitative aspects of social relationships are distinct. This result suggests the importance of studying both dimensions of social relationships in the aging process.},

	abstract = {Parent-teacher relationship ({PTR}) quality is linked to child and family-school functioning and may be especially important in the school adjustment of autistic children. However, measurement of {PTR} quality has been limited by inconsistency in the use of measures, a paucity of twoinformant measurement, and limited psychometric consideration. We examined the psychometric properties of the Parent-Teacher Relationship Quality Scale ({PTRQS}), a parent- and teacherreport measure of {PTR} quality derived from multiple sources. Specifically, we examined the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of the {PTRQS} among parents and teachers of 192 autistic children in preschool to 2nd grade. Results supported a three-factor model, including (1) parent-perceived relationship quality, (2) teacher-perceived comfort with parent(s), and (3) teacher perceptions of parent abilities. Scores exhibited high internal consistency. As evidence of convergent validity, all three factors of {PTR} quality, as well as the total {PTRQS} score, were strongly associated with parent interview-based {PTR} quality, parent perceptions of teacher effectiveness, and teacher-rated parental school involvement. The two teacher-rated {PTR} quality factors were also associated with student-teacher relationship quality. Results indicated that (a) the measure can validly capture {PTR} quality in the context of preschool and early elementary-age autistic children, (b) early {PTR} quality is linked to parental involvement, and (c) teacher-rated {PTR} factors are linked to autistic students' own relationships with their teachers. The results have implications for researchers and school psychologists measuring {PTR} quality in their practice.},

Today, a myriad of organizations continue to assess employees’ job satisfaction on a routine basis (Liu, Borg, \& Spector, 2004). Unfortunately, a sort of balkanization of the field has resulted in the production of dozens of specific measurement tools, making it difficult to cross-compare samples and contexts. The present paper tested the measurement invariance of the Teacher Job Satisfaction Scale ({TJSS}) in six international cohorts (Netherlands, United States, Russia China, Italy and Palestine) of in-service teachers (N = 2,819). Confirmatory factor analysis and multi-group invariance tests were applied. The {TJSS}-9 displayed robust psychometric proprieties and no substantial departures from measurement invariance (configural and metric). Future research is required to further test equivalence across additional countries, with view to developing a truly international tool for measuring job satisfaction in teaching.},

Methods: A study was conducted with high school adolescents from Southern Brazil enrolled in public education (2019). The {QueST} measures screen time across five constructs: studying, working/internship-related activities, watching videos, playing games, using social media/chat applications. Content validation involved consulting with experts and adolescents to evaluate whether the five constructs were clear and representing screen time behaviors, all ratings were quantified. The experts’ evaluation provided Content Validity Indexes ({CVI}) for clarity and representativeness of the questionnaire. Students answered the {QueST} twice (1-week apart), and differences between applications were verified. Test-retest reliability was assessed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ({ICC}) and Bland-Altman analyses. Results: Among the experts, the {CVI} indicated 94\% and 98\% of clarity and representativeness, respectively. All items were highly clear for at least 70\% of the students. Test-retest reliability was assessed with 104 students (16.3 ± 1.02 years; 66.3\% girls). The {ICC} ranged from 0.41 (95\%{CI} 0.24–0.56) for videos to 0.76 (95\%{CI} 0.66–0.83) for social media/chat applications on weekdays; and from 0.24 (95\%{CI} 0.04–0.41) for videos to 0.67 (95\%{CI} 0.54–0.77) for social media/chat applications on weekends. The lowest mean difference was -4.6 min for working on weekdays, while the highest was 40.6 min for videos on weekends. Conclusions: The {QueST} proved to be fair to excellent for measuring different screen time constructs. However, the item of videos (weekends) showed poor stability. The {QueST} demonstrates satisfactory content validity attested by the experts and adolescents. {KEYWORDSAdolescent} behavior; Self-report; Sedentary behavior; Validation study; Reproducibility of results},

Using a sample of 616 emerging adults in college, exploratory factor analysis was conducted with a calibration sample of 308 participants and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted using an equal hold-out sample to yield a final 10-item two-factor Social Media Use Integration Scale ({SMUIS}). Strong reliability evidence was found for data collected with the total scale (α = .914), the first 6-item subscale called Social Integration and Emotional Connection ({SIEC}) (α = .893), and the second 4-item subscale entitled Integration into Social Routines ({ISR}) (α = .828). Test–retest over a 3-week period suggested that {SMUIS} responses remained stable, with reliability correlations of r = .803 for total scale, r = .804 for subscale 1, and r = .676 for subscale 2. In addition, high correlations with previously published social media use measures provided convergent validity evidence, whereas nonsignificant correlations between the {SMUIS} subscales and other measures unrelated to online social media use offered discriminant validity evidence. The {SMUIS} was first developed to measure Facebook use; however, it was purposefully designed to be adapted to measure other forms of online social media use. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2024 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Findings showed that different types of social media use very rarely yielded different effects within one and the same adolescent: 45\% of adolescents experienced no changes in well-being due to any of the three types of social media use, 28\% only experienced declines in well-being, and 26\% only experienced increases in well-being. Only one adolescent experienced the theoretically expected effect pattern of a positive effect of active private and passive private use and negative effect of passive public use.

	abstract = {Background: Implementation outcome measures are essential for monitoring and evaluating the success of implementation efforts. Yet, currently available measures lack conceptual clarity and have largely unknown reliability and validity. This study developed and psychometrically assessed three new measures: the Acceptability of Intervention Measure ({AIM}), Intervention Appropriateness Measure ({IAM}), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure ({FIM}). Methods: Thirty-six implementation scientists and 27 mental health professionals assigned 31 items to the constructs and rated their confidence in their assignments. The Wilcoxon one-sample signed rank test was used to assess substantive and discriminant content validity. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis ({EFA} and {CFA}) and Cronbach alphas were used to assess the validity of the conceptual model. Three hundred twenty-six mental health counselors read one of six randomly assigned vignettes depicting a therapist contemplating adopting an evidence-based practice ({EBP}). Participants used 15 items to rate the therapist’s perceptions of the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of adopting the {EBP}. {CFA} and Cronbach alphas were used to refine the scales, assess structural validity, and assess reliability. Analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) was used to assess known-groups validity. Finally, half of the counselors were randomly assigned to receive the same vignette and the other half the opposite vignette; and all were asked to re-rate acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess test-retest reliability and linear regression to assess sensitivity to change. Results: All but five items exhibited substantive and discriminant content validity. A trimmed {CFA} with five items per construct exhibited acceptable model fit ({CFI} = 0.98, {RMSEA} = 0.08) and high factor loadings (0.79 to 0.94). The alphas for 5-item scales were between 0.87 and 0.89. Scale refinement based on measure-specific {CFAs} and Cronbach alphas using vignette data produced 4-item scales (α’s from 0.85 to 0.91). A three-factor {CFA} exhibited acceptable fit ({CFI} = 0.96, {RMSEA} = 0.08) and high factor loadings (0.75 to 0.89), indicating structural validity. {ANOVA} showed significant main effects, indicating known-groups validity. Test-retest reliability coefficients ranged from 0.73 to 0.88. Regression analysis indicated each measure was sensitive to change in both directions. Conclusions: The {AIM}, {IAM}, and {FIM} demonstrate promising psychometric properties. Predictive validity assessment is planned.},

The Wheel and its accompanying assessment tool—the Motivation and Engagement Scale ({MES})—comprise eleven first‐order factors (under four higher‐order factors): self‐efficacy, valuing, and mastery orientation (adaptive cognition); planning, task management, and persistence (adaptive behaviour); anxiety, failure avoidance, and uncertain control (impeding/maladaptive cognition); and self‐handicapping and disengagement (maladaptive behaviour). We describe theoretical foundations of the {MES}, summarise corresponding forms of the {MES} for use in academic, work, sport, and music settings, and report on their psychometric properties in local and cross‐cultural settings. We then review {MES} research addressing substantive and applied issues, focusing on educational research (i.e., looking at use of the {MES} to explore the effects of gender, grade retention, delayed school entry, taking a gap year, and the role of the home on motivation and engagement). Through psychometric and substantive applications, it is proposed that this integrative approach to multidimensional motivation and engagement instrumentation has utility across diverse performance and cultural settings, educational levels, and academic subjects. As such, it can be considered a meaningful recent contribution to psycho‐educational measurement, research, theory, and practice.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Mobile phone bans in secondary schools are claimed to reduce student distraction and promote learning and face-to-face socializing. Currently, the evidence on phone bans is limited. The aim of this preregistered study was to evaluate the South Australian mobile phone ban’s effects on students’ problematic phone use, academic engagement, school belonging, and bullying. The study also sought to identify student variables that predict phone ban compliance. Methods: As the ban was phased in over 2023, a 2 (phone ban: yes/no) 3 2 (time: baseline, 1-month follow-up) repeated-measures design was employed. Students (n 5 1,282 at baseline; n 5 1,256 at follow-up) in Grades 7 to 12 were recruited from ﬁve public secondary schools. Surveys included measures drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children ({LSAC}) and the Programme for International Student Assessment ({PISA}). Results: Problematic phone use was reported by 2.6\% of the sample. Being older and a more frequent user of social media predicted lower phone ban compliance. Linear mixed models indicated that ban and no ban school groups did not differ significantly in terms of problematic phone use, academic engagement, and school belonging. There was slightly higher bullying in the ban group but bullying decreased significantly in both groups. Discussion: Imposing access restrictions may not affect the underlying psychological mechanisms that drive problematic phone use. Although these results indicate limited to no short-term beneﬁts of the ban, further evaluation with more sensitive methodologies is recommended. Conclusions: Student-technology interactions in learning institutions should be continually monitored to determine the optimal balance to support student etiquette, learning, and wellbeing.},

In a public high school sample (n ¼ 585), 24.7\% of students felt unsafe and 14.4\% avoided school due to feeling unsafe during the past month. Being female and experiencing bullying was associated with feeling unsafe. However, after accounting for demographics and bullying victimization, perceptions of safety increased when students reported positive student and teacher relations, consistent rules, a clean school that is also crowded/noisy, and a sense of school belonging. Avoiding school because of safety concerns was related to decreased school belonging and teacher/student relationships, but not bullying. Focusing on enhancing the school climate/ environment, facilitating student belongingness, and reducing bullying are ways school nurses can help promote safer schools.},

On the upside, these social resources provide a multitude of opportunities for interaction; on the downside, they often broadcast more options than can be pursued, given practical restrictions and limited time. This dual nature of social media has driven popular interest in the concept of Fear of Missing Out – popularly referred to as {FoMO}. Deﬁned as a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent, {FoMO} is characterized by the desire to stay continually connected with what others are doing. The present research presents three studies conducted to advance an empirically based understanding of the fear of missing out phenomenon. The ﬁrst study collected a diverse international sample of participants in order to create a robust individual differences measure of {FoMO}, the Fear of Missing Out scale ({FoMOs}); this study is the ﬁrst to operationalize the construct. Study 2 recruited a nationally representative cohort to investigate how demographic, motivational and well-being factors relate to {FoMO}. Study 3 examined the behavioral and emotional correlates of fear of missing out in a sample of young adults. Implications of the {FoMOs} measure and for the future study of {FoMO} are discussed.},

However, no large studies in the United States have examined the prevalence of bullying during elementary school or its association with objective measures of school attendance and achievement.To determine the prevalence of bullying during elementary school and its association with school attendance, academic achievement, disciplinary actions, and self-reported feelings of sadness, safety, and belonging.Cross-sectional study using 2001-2002 school data.Urban, West Coast public school district.Three thousand five hundred thirty (91.4\%) third, fourth, and fifth grade students.Self-reported involvement in bullying.Twenty-two percent of children surveyed were involved in bullying either as a victim, bully, or both. Victims and bully-victims were more likely to have low achievement than bystanders (odds ratios [{ORs}], 0.8 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 0.7-0.9] and 0.8 [95\% {CI}, 0.6-1.0], respectively). All 3 bullying-involved groups were significantly more likely than bystanders to feel unsafe at school (victims, {OR}, 2.1 [95\% {CI}, 1.1-4.2]; bullies, {OR}, 2.5 [95\% {CI}, 1.5-4.1]; bully-victims, {OR}, 5.0 [95\% {CI}, 1.9-13.6]).

The cross-sectional sample of adolescents is nationally representative and is composed of 4,610 middle and high school students ages twelve to eighteen (51\% male, average age 14.7). Using General Strain Theory as a backdrop, we contribute to the extant literature by making an empirical distinction between social (also known as relational), verbal, physical, and cyberbullying victimization. Ordinal regression results show that while a composite measure of bullying victimization does attenuate a youth’s academic performance, most of this effect is due to social bullying victimization which remains robust notwithstanding a multitude of model specifications.},

Although sex differences in the magnitude of these provisions were expected, it was hypothesized that the characteristics would function in a similar manner to promote friendship satisfaction. An additional goal was to provide an empirical evaluation of the relative contribution of the three types of provisions to friendship satisfaction. In Study 1, trust in male and female friends (intimacy), orientation to assistance (communal and exchange) and companionship attributes of friends were examined as elements of the individual's cognitive conceptions of friendships. The females (n = 94) reported greater trust in males, a more communal orientation to assistance and greater friendship satisfaction. Regression analyses revealed that for both males (n = 80) and females, trust in male friends contributed to friendship satisfaction while an exchange orientation detracted from it. In Study 2, Seventy-eight males and sixty females indicated the levels of self-disclosure, reciprocal exchange of assistance, enjoyment and negativity in their established friendships. Sex differences were evident in the magnitude of self-disclosure and friendship satisfaction reported by males and females. For both males and females, self-disclosure and friendship enjoyment were the significant predictors of friendship satisfaction. Overall, this research demonstrates that the characteristics associated with intimacy, namely self-disclosure and trust, and the affective tone associated with companionship are the most important contributors to friendship satisfaction for both males and females.},

This study compared a brief 12-item Gatehouse Bullying Scale ({GBS}) with items drawn from the Peer Relations Questionnaire ({PRQ}), a well-established bullying questionnaire to measure the concurrent validity of the {GBS}. Methods: Year 8 secondary school students (14 years of age) in metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia, completed questionnaires assessing being teased, being deliberately left out, had rumors spread about oneself, and/or being physically threatened or hurt. Results: The prevalence of bullying using {GBS} and {PRQ} was 57\% and 61\%, respectively. Percent agreement between the 2 measures was high. Agreement adjusted for chance was moderate (kappa 0.5). The {GBS} had good to moderate test-retest reliability (rho 0.65). Conclusions: The {GBS} is a short, reliable tool measuring the occurrence of bullying in schools. As well as a global estimate of bullying, the {GBS} provides estimates of 2 covert and 2 overt types of bullying which can be useful for schools to better plan interventions dealing with school bullying.},

Aims This study developed and validated a survey tool that integrates measurement of both traditional and cyber bullying to test a theoretically driven multi-dimensional model. Sample Adolescents from 10 mainstream secondary schools completed a baseline and follow-up survey (N = 1,217; Mage = 14 years; 66.2\% male). Methods The Bullying and cyberbullying Scale for Adolescents ({BCS}-A) developed for this study comprised parallel victimization and perpetration subscales, each with 20 items. Additional measures of bullying (Olweus Global Bullying and the Forms of Bullying Scale [{FBS}]), as well as measures of internalizing and externalizing problems, school connectedness, social support, and personality, were used to further assess validity. Results Factor structure was determined, and then, the suitability of items was assessed according to the following criteria: (1) factor interpretability, (2) item correlations, (3) model parsimony, and (4) measurement equivalence across victimization and perpetration experiences. The final models comprised four factors: physical, verbal, relational, and cyber. The final scale was revised to two 13-item subscales. The {BCS}-A demonstrated acceptable concurrent and convergent validity (internalizing and externalizing problems, school connectedness, social support, and personality), as well as predictive validity over 6 months. Conclusions The {BCS}-A has sound psychometric properties. This tool establishes measurement equivalence across types of involvement and behavioural forms common among adolescents. An improved measurement method could add greater rigour to the evaluation of intervention programmes and also enable interventions to be tailored to subscale profiles.},

The Depression Scale ({DEPS}), consisting of 10 items, was developed and tested in primary care patients aged 18 to 64 years. Clinical assessments were made on the basis of Present State Examination interviews with 436 patients. The {DEPS} proved to be satisfactory. Increasing age and poor education had an adverse effect on the screening process, however. The sensitivity of the {DEPS} for clinical depression was 74\% and the specificity for non-depression 85\%. The sensitivity for severe depression was 84\% and the specificity for symptom-free patients 93\%. The {DEPS} seems to improve the recognition of depression in primary care and may also be suitable for screening depression in the general population and for identifying high-risk groups.},

            We learn in a variety of ways: through direct sensory experience, by talking with others, and by thinking. Disentangling how these sources contribute to what we know is challenging. A wedge into this puzzle was suggested by empiricist philosophers, who hypothesized that people born blind would lack deep knowledge of “visual” phenomena such as color. We find that, contrary to this prediction, congenitally blind and sighted individuals share in-depth understanding of object color. Blind and sighted people share similar intuitions about which objects will have consistent colors, make similar predictions for novel objects, and give similar explanations. Living among people who talk about color is sufficient for color understanding, highlighting the efficiency of linguistic communication as a source of knowledge.
          , 
            Empiricist philosophers such as Locke famously argued that people born blind might learn arbitrary color facts (e.g., marigolds are yellow) but would lack color understanding. Contrary to this intuition, we find that blind and sighted adults share causal understanding of color, despite not always agreeing about arbitrary color facts. Relative to sighted people, blind individuals are less likely to generate “yellow” for banana and “red” for stop sign but make similar generative inferences about real and novel objects’ colors, and provide similar causal explanations. For example, people infer that two natural kinds (e.g., bananas) and two artifacts with functional colors (e.g., stop signs) are more likely to have the same color than two artifacts with nonfunctional colors (e.g., cars). People develop intuitive and inferentially rich “theories” of color regardless of visual experience. Linguistic communication is more effective at aligning intuitive theories than knowledge of arbitrary facts.},

In this study, we compared preference for images of abstract and familiar objects in the original format or when containing perfect bilateral symmetry. We created pairs of images for different categories: male faces, female faces, polygons, smoothed version of the polygons, ﬂowers, and landscapes. This design allows us to compare symmetry preference in different domains. Each observer saw all categories randomly interleaved but saw only one of the two images in a pair. After recording preference, we recorded a rating of how salient the symmetry was for each image, and measured how quickly observers could decide which of the two images in a pair was symmetrical. Results reveal a general preference for symmetry in the case of shapes and faces. For landscapes, natural (no perfect symmetry) images were preferred. Correlations with judgments of saliency were present but generally low, and for landscapes the salience of symmetry was negatively related to preference. However, even within the category where symmetry was not liked (landscapes), the separate analysis of original and modiﬁed stimuli showed an interesting pattern: Salience of symmetry was correlated positively (artiﬁcial) or negatively (original) with preference, suggesting different effects of symmetry within the same class of stimuli based on context and categorization.},

Although there are many instruments available to assess self-harm behaviors, few have been validated for use with adolescents, and even fewer have been validated for use with different racial/ethnic groups. The Self-Harm Behavior Questionnaire ({SHBQ}) assesses {NSSI}, suicidal ideation, suicide threats, and past suicide attempts. Data from 1,386 racially/ethnically diverse adolescents (57.5\% minority) were collected to examine the validity of the {SHBQ} in this age group. Analyses supported the four-factor structure, revealed the {SHBQ} is internally consistent, and provided evidence for convergent validity within Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic adolescents. However, slight differences were noted. Overall, the findings suggest the {SHBQ} is a useful assessment tool appropriate for use with Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic adolescents.},

The {SAS}-{TR} was found to have acceptable internal consistency, appropriate relationships with other teacher report scales, and was positively correlated with parent report of child anxiety. Gender and age effects on total and subscale scores were not evident. Clinical utility was evident with the scale discriminating between the community and clinical groups, correctly classifying a large proportion of anxiety disordered children and showing sensitivity to changes in anxiety with treatment. The {SAS}-{TR} complements existing measures and can be used within a multi-informant approach to the assessment of child anxiety.},

Increased mobile maintenance expectations positively predicted dependence, which increased satisfaction, and positively predicted overdependence, which decreased satisfaction.

            The measurement of students' social support has become a popular topic in education and psychology, yet measurement tools in this area are limited. In this study, we use a large, representative sample to conduct confirmatory factor, reliability, and correlational analyses of scores on the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale ({CASSS}; Malecki, Demaray, Elliott, \& Nolten, 1999). These analyses revealed evidence of reliability, a four‐factor structure (Parent, Teacher, Classmate, and Close Friend subscales), and construct validity. The results of this study indicate that the {CASSS} covaries as predicted with the clinically important constructs of self‐concept, social skills, and behavioral indicators. There is evidence that the {CASSS} can be used to understand children and adolescents' perceived social support. © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Objectives: We examined the associations of smartphone usage duration and content type with dietary risk factors among adolescents.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using a nationally representative sample of 54,601 middle- and high-school students (aged 12–18 y; 26,928 boys and 27,673 girls) in the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-Based Survey 2017. Smartphone use (average duration and most frequently used content type) and dietary intakes [frequent breakfast skipping; less frequent intakes of fruits and vegetables; more frequent intakes of instant noodles, fast food, chips/crackers, and sugar-sweetened beverages ({SSBs})] were self-reported via an online-based questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to estimate {ORs} and 95\% {CIs} for the associations of smartphone usage duration and content type with prevalence of dietary risk factors, adjusting for potential confounders. All analyses accounted for complex survey sampling.
Results: Prolonged smartphone use (≥300 compared with 1–59 min/d) was associated with ({OR}; 95\% {CI}) higher prevalence of frequent breakfast skipping (1.60; 1.45, 1.76); frequent intakes of instant noodles (1.65; 1.47, 1.84), fast food (1.36; 1.20, 1.53), and {SSBs} (1.92; 1.75, 2.11); and less frequent intakes of fruits (1.44; 1.30, 1.59) and vegetables (1.32; 1.18, 1.47). Adjusting for usage duration, using smartphones mainly for messenger/e-mail, social networking service ({SNS})/forum, and games were associated with less frequent intakes of fruits ({OR}: 1.21; 95\% {CI}: 1.12, 1.31; {OR}: 1.28; 95\% {CI}: 1.17, 1.40; and {OR}: 1.20; 95\% {CI}: 1.10, 1.32, respectively) and vegetables ({OR}: 1.24; 95\% {CI}: 1.12, 1.37; {OR}: 1.26; 95\% {CI}: 1.13, 1.40; and {OR}: 1.25; 95\% {CI}: 1.12, 1.40, respectively) than was using smartphones for education/information search. Using smartphones mainly for messenger/e-mail ({OR}: 1.24; 95\% {CI}: 1.14, 1.35) and {SNS}/forum ({OR}: 1.18; 95\% {CI}: 1.08, 1.29) were also associated with more frequent intake of {SSBs}.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that both duration and content type of smartphone use are independently associated with dietary risk factors among adolescents. J Nutr 2022;152:2109–2116.},

One hundred and thirty eight participants logged all foods and drinks consumed using {MyFitnessPal} and submitted smartphone screen time data for three consecutive days (Thursday through Saturday). Results revealed no significant associations between smartphone use and calorie consumption on any of the three study days. Additionally, morning phone use did not predict calories eaten during subsequent meals on any day. The type of phone use (e.g., social networking, reading, etc.) was also not related to total daily calorie intake. These findings on eating behavior in daily life contradict laboratory research, suggesting that smartphone use may not promote increased calorie intake in the same way that television viewing does.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: Adolescents are more likely to experience problematic smartphone use ({PSU}) due to developmental immaturity. As most previous studies have focused on cross-sectional relationships between {PSU}, self-control, and physical activity, it is difficult to make valid inferences about their causal relationships and long-term effects. This study aims to investigate the interrelationships between these three variables through a mediation analysis based on a cross-lagged model in a longitudinal design.
Methods: A total of 2131 participants (Mage = 12.14, {SD} = 2.29, 51.5\% female) were surveyed at three time points with 1-year intervals. Smartphone Addiction Proneness Scale ({SAPS}) and revised Self-Control Scale were used to assess {PSU} and self-control respectively. Physical activity was measured with an item questioning frequency of physical activity.
Results: Cross-lagged model showed that both self-control and physical activity were negatively and bidirectionally associated with {PSU}. Self-control had a positive predictive effect on physical activity at the next time point. Additionally, self-control positively predicted subsequent physical activity, which in turn negatively predicted subsequent {PSU}, indicating a mediating effect of physical activity between self-control and {PSU}.
Conclusion: Self-control and physical activity had a long-term effect on reducing the propensity for {PSU}. Because of the accessibility and operability of physical activity interventions, the public and policy-makers need to prioritize physical activity as an intervention to prevent {PSU} in adolescents.},

Design: Items for the measure were selected from a larger pool on the basis of responses from a pilot study. The 23-item checklist was validated using measures of dietary fat and ﬁbre intake, fruit and vegetable consumption, dietary restraint, nutrition knowledge and a measure of family income. Setting: Participants came from seven secondary schools in the north-west of England. Subjects: A total of 1822 adolescents aged between 13 and 16 y took part in the study, representing 84\% of those invited to participate.
Results: Correlations between measures indicate a good level of convergent validity, and the checklist is also shown to have high internal and test – retest reliability.
Conclusions: The focus on choices available to adolescents means that the checklist will provide a useful addition to food frequency-type approaches to the measurement of adolescent eating behaviour.

	abstract = {Background. To address limited longitudinal nutrition data on children and adolescents, a self-administered food frequency questionnaire was designed for older children and adolescents. Initially, the Youth/ Adolescent Questionnaire ({YAQ}) was developed and demonstrated to be reproducible. This study was conducted to evaluate its validity.
Methods. The form was administered twice to a sample of 261 youths (ages 9 to 18) at an approximate interval of 1 year (1993–1994), and three 24-hr dietary recalls were collected during this period. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated on nutrient data.
Results. Validity was ﬁrst evaluated by comparing the average of the three 24-hr recalls to the average of the two {YAQs}. Similar mean nutrients were found by both methods. Correlation coefficients between the mean energy-adjusted nutrients computed by the two methods ranged from 0.21 for sodium to 0.58 for folate. After correction for within-person error, the average correlation coefficient was 0.54, similar to that found among adults.
Conclusion. A simple self-administered questionnaire completed by older children and adolescents can provide nutritional information about this age group. © 1997 Academic Press},

The results from the {EFA} revealed a single-factor structure for {IGD} that was also conﬁrmed by the {CFA}. The nine items of the {IGDS}-{SF}9 are valid, reliable, and proved to be highly suitable for measuring {IGD}. It is envisaged that the {IGDS}-{SF}9 will help facilitate uniﬁed research in the ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Objective: Despite the high prevalence of adolescents’ pornography use and increasing societal concerns about it, the examination of problematic pornography use ({PPU}) among this population is still scarce, potentially due to the lack of well-validated, reliable measures. The aims of the present study were to validate a short, theory-based measure of {PPU} in a diverse sample of adolescents and identify a potentially at-risk problematic pornography user group. Method: We used a sample of 802 adolescents (35\% girls; 14\% sexual minority; Mage = 15.4 years, {SD} = 0.6) who reported lifetime pornography use, collected as part of an ongoing longitudinal study on adolescents’ sexual health. To examine the psychometric properties of the short, six-item version of the Problematic Pornography Consumption Scale for adolescents ({PPCS}-6-A), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis, gender and sexual orientation measurement invariance testing, and assessed theoretically relevant correlates (e.g., masturbation frequency). We conducted latent profile analysis to identify adolescents at risk of {PPU}. Results: The {PPCS}-6-A demonstrated strong psychometric properties in terms of factor structure, measurement invariance (i.e., boys vs. girls, and heterosexual vs. sexual minority adolescents), and reliability, and correlated reasonably with the assessed variables. Ten percent of participants were identified as being at-risk of {PPU}. Conclusions: The {PPCS}-6-A can be considered a short, reliable, and valid scale to assess {PPU} in adolescents, and may distinguish between low-risk and at-risk problematic users. Its use in future studies could lead to a better understanding of the prevalence and characteristics of adolescents’ {PPU}. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2021 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

A minority of individuals, especially younger adults, may engage excessively with the medium, resulting in the emergence of problematic social media use ({PSMU}). One way of assessing {PSMU} is by administering the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale ({BSMAS}). The present study investigated the psychometric properties and prevalence of the {BSMAS} using Item Response Theory ({IRT}). Additionally, it evaluated risk factors such as gender and age.
Methods: A relatively large community sample (N = 968, Mage = 29.5 years, {SD} = 9.36, 32.5\% women) completed the {BSMAS} online.
Results: {IRT} analyses showed differences regarding the {BSMAS} items’ discrimination, difficulty, and reliability capacities, with a raw score exceeding 26 (out of 30) indicating a higher risk of {PSMU} (n = 11; 1.1\%). Females and younger participants were at greater risk of developing {PSMU}.
Conclusion: The {BSMAS} functions as a reliable measure of {PSMU}, particularly between average to high levels of the trait. Additionally, younger participants were shown to be at higher risk of {PSMU} suggesting that prevention and intervention protocols should focus on this group.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, research into “addictive technological behaviors” has substantially increased. Research has also demonstrated strong associations between addictive use of technology and comorbid psychiatric disorders. In the present study, 23,533 adults (mean age 35.8 years, ranging from 16 to 88 years) participated in an online cross-sectional survey examining whether demographic variables, symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}), obsessive-compulsive disorder ({OCD}), anxiety, and depression could explain variance in addictive use (i.e., compulsive and excessive use associated with negative outcomes) of two types of modern online technologies: social media and video games. Correlations between symptoms of addictive technology use and mental disorder symptoms were all positive and significant, including the weak interrelationship between the two addictive technological behaviors. Age appeared to be inversely related to the addictive use of these technologies. Being male was significantly associated with addictive use of video games, whereas being female was significantly associated with addictive use of social media. Being single was positively related to both addictive social networking and video gaming. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that demographic factors explained between 11 and 12\% of the variance in addictive technology use. The mental health variables explained between 7 and 15\% of the variance. The study significantly adds to our understanding of mental health symptoms and their role in addictive use of modern technology, and suggests that the concept of Internet use disorder (i.e., “Internet addiction”) as a unified construct is not warranted.

	abstract = {Despite the large number of measurement tools developed to assess problematic Internet use, numerous studies use measures with only modest investigation into their psychometric properties. The goal of the present study was to validate the short (6-item) version of the Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire ({PIUQ}) on a nationally representative adolescent sample (n = 5,005; mean age 16.4 years, {SD} = 0.87) and to determine a statistically established cut-off value. Data were collected within the framework of the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs project. Results showed an acceptable fit of the original three-factor structure to the data. In addition, a {MIMIC} model was carried out to justify the need for three distinct factors. The sample was divided into users at-risk of problematic Internet use and those with no-risk using a latent profile analysis. Two latent classes were obtained with 14.4\% of adolescents belonging to the at-risk group. Concurrent and convergent validity were tested by comparing the two groups across a number of variables (i.e., time spent online, academic achievement, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and preferred online activities). Using the at-risk latent profile analysis class as the gold standard, a cut-off value of 15 (out of 30) was suggested based on sensitivity and specificity analyses. In conclusion, the brief version of the (6-item) {PIUQ} also appears to be an appropriate measure to differentiate between Internet users at risk of developing problematic Internet use and those not at risk. Furthermore, due to its brevity, the shortened {PIUQ} is advantageous to utilize within large-scale surveys assessing many different behaviors and/or constructs by reducing the overall number of survey questions, and as a consequence, likely increasing completion rates.},

The current study reports on the development and validation of a parent-report measure of one potential aspect of children’s problematic use—screen media addiction—via the Problematic Media Use Measure ({PMUM}). Items were based on the 9 criteria for Internet gaming disorder in the {DSM}–5. The first study describes the development and preliminary validation of the {PMUM} in a sample of 291 mothers. Mothers (80.8\% identified as White) of children aged four through 11 years of age completed the {PMUM}, and measures of child screen time and child psychosocial functioning. Exploratory factor analyses indicated a unidimensional construct of screen media addiction. The final versions of the {PMUM} (27 items) and {PMUM} Short Form ({PMUM}-{SF}; 9 items) evidenced high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .97 and α = .93, respectively). Regression analyses were conducted to examine the convergent validity of the {PMUM} with indicators of child psychosocial functioning. Convergent validity was supported, and the {PMUM} scales also independently predicted children’s total difficulties in functioning, over and above hours of screen time, indicating incremental validity. The second study sought to confirm the factor structure of the {PMUM}-{SF} and test for measurement invariance across gender. In a sample of 632 parents, we confirmed the factor structure of the {PMUM}-{SF} and found measurement invariance for boys and girls. These studies support the use of the {PMUM}-{SF} as a measure of screen media addiction in children aged 4 through 11 years old. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2020 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Content validity and face validity of the scale was provided via ﬁeld specialists’ judgment. Conﬁrmatory and exploratory factor analyses were performed for investigation of the factor structure of the scale. As a result of principal component analysis of cyber victim subscale three factors emerged which accounted for the 46.38\% of the total variance. Also for cyber bullying subscale, same three factors emerged accounting for the 49.18\% of the total variance. Scales with 22 items under 3 factors were tested with conﬁrmatory factor analysis for each victim and bullying variables. Three factors were named as cyber verbal bullying, hiding identity and cyber forgery. Three factors model of scales were found theoretically and statistically ﬁtted after conﬁrmatory factor analysis. For criterion related validity the correlation between cyber victim and bullying scale and Aggression Scale was calculated as .27 and .36, respectively. The internal consistency coefﬁcients calculated for reliability. Cyber victim and bullying scales’ internal consistency coefﬁcients were .89 and split-half coefﬁcients were .79. for both scales. Test-retest reliability for cyber victim .85, for cyber bullying respectively .90 was found. These results demonstrate that the Cyber Victim and Bullying Scale’ is a valid and reliable instrument.},

administered the Ottawa Acceptability of Decision Rules Instrument ({OADRI}) via postal
survey to emergency physicians from 4 regions (Australasia, Canada, United Kingdom,
and United States), in the context of 2 recently developed rules, the Canadian
C-Spine Rule (C-Spine) and the Canadian {CT} Head Rule ({CT}-Head). Construct validity of
the 12-item instrument was evaluated by hypothesis testing. Results. As predicted by
a priori hypotheses, {OADRI} scores were 1) higher among rule users than nonusers, 2)
higher among those using the rule ??all of the time?? v. ??most of the time?? v.
??some of the time,?? and 3) higher among rule nonusers who would consider using a
rule v. those who would not. We also examined explicit reasons given by respondents
who said they would not use these rules. Items in the {OADRI} accounted for 85.5\% (C-
Spine) and 90.2\% ({CT}-Head) of the reasons given for not considering a rule
acceptable. Conclusions. The {OADRI} is a simple, 12-item instrument that evaluates
rule acceptability among clinicians. Potential uses include comparing multiple
??protorules?? during development, examining acceptability of a rule to a new
audience prior to implementation, indicating barriers to rule use addressable by

	abstract = {Interpersonal conflict is a prevalent workplace problem associated with numerous adverse consequences for both employees (e.g., depression, negative affect) and organizations (e.g., turnover, reduced productivity). However, many currently available self-report measures suffer from multiple methodological challenges that substantially hinder accurate and comprehensive measurement including the lack of specific elements of conflict identified by the literature subsequent to measure development, and a lack of rigorous empirical examination of psychometric properties. Thus, there is a need for a valid, psychometrically sound scale that can briefly capture perceptions of workplace interpersonal conflict in a contemporary work environment. The Workplace Interpersonal Conflict Scale ({WICS}) was developed to examine the frequency of conflict characteristics identified from a prior qualitative study of interpersonal conflict themes. In the current examination, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the psychometric properties of the {WICS} across 3 occupational samples including a cross-sectional study in health care (home care workers), a pre/post study in service (food service workers), and a large, diverse online sample (via {MTurk}). Results supported the 6-item {WICS} as a valid measure of workplace interpersonal conflict related to many other important workplace variables in the domains of work, health, and safety. Practical implications are presented and discussed. The {WICS} offers a promising measure that can be used in assessment, remediation, and prevention of noxious interpersonal cultures within the workplace.},

The continued research and practical effort require measures to examine teachers’ stress in a briefer and accurate manner. The Teacher Stress Scale is a recently developed brief measure to examine teacher stress with promising psychometric characteristics. The present study aims to further validate {TSS} scores with a large sample of teachers ranging from pre-kindergarten to the 12th grade from the United States and United Kingdom. Findings of the internal structure validity, convergent validity, and the internal consistency reliability of {TSS} scores were examined. Specifically, the confirmatory factor analysis of the unidimensional model and the two-dimensional model showed poor fit, but the bi-factor model evidenced a strong fit. Factorial invariance testing yielded strong invariance between early education and secondary education teachers as well as satisfactory invariance between teachers from the United States and the United Kingdoms. The Inadequate School-Based Support {TSS} subscale demonstrated convergent validity with other support measures, and the overall {TSS} showed acceptable internal consistency reliability evidence of scores. Limitations and implications of the {TSS}, as well as future research directions were discussed.},

We examined the {PEECE} Survey factor structure; item difficulty; discrimination; measurement invariance; and associations with children’s kindergarten readiness, school absenteeism, and teachers’ ratings of parent engagement among 304 parents of kindergarteners (74\% mothers, 68.4\% African American, 63.2\% single parents, 59.2\% low-income). Factor analyses revealed 3 {PEECE} Survey factors: Knowledge/Expectations, Trust/Communication, and Home-based Engagement (factor reliabilities ranged from 0.63 to 0.85). There was minimal evidence of differential item functioning by parent and child characteristics. {PEECE} subscale scores were significantly positively associated with kindergarten readiness and teacher ratings of parent’s engagement; and significantly negatively related to kindergarten absenteeism. Subscale scores did not differ by parents’ income level, marital status, or education or by child gender; African American parents reported higher scores on Knowledge/Expectations. Results suggest the 25-item {PEECE} Survey is a valid and equitable measure of parent engagement, capturing behaviors and perspectives that are feasible for parents with limited incomes and resources and linked to indicators of children’s early academic success.},

The questionnaire developed in this study, the Child-to-Parent Aggression Questionnaire ({CPAQ}), includes forms of physical and psychological aggression directed at both the mother and the father. It also includes open questions about the reasons for the aggressive acts. The {CPAQ} was completed by a sample of 2719 adolescents (age range: 13–18 years old, 51.4\% girls). Conﬁrmatory factor analysis supported a four-factor correlated structure (physical aggression against mother, physical aggression against father, psychological aggression against mother, and psychological aggression against father). Psychological and physical aggression against the mother was more frequent than against the father. However, there were no differences with regard to severe forms of aggression. Girls scored signiﬁcantly higher on all indicators of psychological aggression, including severe psychological aggression. Nevertheless, except for the prevalence of physical aggression against mothers, which was higher in females, there were no signiﬁcant differences in physical aggression against parents. Finally, the reasons provided by the adolescents for the aggression included both instrumental (e.g., to obtain permission to get home late and to access their computers) and reactive reasons (e.g., anger and self-defense). These ﬁndings highlight the complexity of child-to-parent aggression in adolescence.},

However, measurement of {PTR} quality has been limited by inconsistency in the use of measures, a paucity of twoinformant measurement, and limited psychometric consideration. We examined the psychometric properties of the Parent-Teacher Relationship Quality Scale ({PTRQS}), a parent- and teacherreport measure of {PTR} quality derived from multiple sources. Specifically, we examined the factor structure, reliability, and convergent validity of the {PTRQS} among parents and teachers of 192 autistic children in preschool to 2nd grade. Results supported a three-factor model, including (1) parent-perceived relationship quality, (2) teacher-perceived comfort with parent(s), and (3) teacher perceptions of parent abilities. Scores exhibited high internal consistency. As evidence of convergent validity, all three factors of {PTR} quality, as well as the total {PTRQS} score, were strongly associated with parent interview-based {PTR} quality, parent perceptions of teacher effectiveness, and teacher-rated parental school involvement. The two teacher-rated {PTR} quality factors were also associated with student-teacher relationship quality. Results indicated that (a) the measure can validly capture {PTR} quality in the context of preschool and early elementary-age autistic children, (b) early {PTR} quality is linked to parental involvement, and (c) teacher-rated {PTR} factors are linked to autistic students' own relationships with their teachers. The results have implications for researchers and school psychologists measuring {PTR} quality in their practice.},

Nevertheless, research on teacher emotions has been slow to emerge, and scales for their assessment via self-report are generally lacking. In the present research we developed four-item scales for three emotions considered most relevant in the context of teaching: enjoyment, anger, and anxiety (Teacher Emotions Scales, {TES}). Based on data of 944 teachers, we tested German and English language versions of the {TES} for reliability, internal and external validity, and cross-language equivalence, while exploring the utility of both a general and a student-group specific variant. All scales proved to be highly reliable, and confirmatory factor analysis supported internal validity by showing that three-factor models (enjoyment, anger, and anxiety) were superior to single-factor or two-factor (positive vs. negative affect) models. The external validation analyses provided consistent evidence for theoretically meaningful relations with teachers’ general affect, burnout, job satisfaction, and teacher self-efficacy. These findings were robust across multiple studies. In addition, consistent relationships with student ratings of teaching behaviors were found. Analyses of measurement invariance revealed that the English and the German language versions were fully structurally equivalent und displayed metric invariance.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Sharing nude photos and exchanging intimacy favors transcends the threshold from hidden and private content into public consciousness. Ever-present is the differentiation between an image shared by consent and those not consented to and distributed as part of harassment, revenge, and abuse. Similarly, the continuum of exchanging intimacy moves across normative boundaries some see as unproblematic and occur in many sexual and romantic encounters, while others can be experienced as problematic. The purpose of this quantitative study is in a low-risk setting to investigate basic characteristics in the spread of the phenomenon of sugar-dating and nude photo sharing among adolescents.
Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was sent to all 9th grade classes at schools in a single Danish municipality for three consecutive years from 2020 to 2022 with pupils and teachers not notified in advance. The survey included questions on gender identity, sugar-dating, sharing nude photos, and, from 2022, consent and setting up boundaries to sex.
Results: Of 729 pupils 541 (74\%) answered the questionnaire. More pupils with sexual debut sent nude photos of themselves via tablet/phones/computers, received nude photos and had passed them on than those without sexual debut, while no gender difference was found. More than four times as many pupils had received nude photos than pupils who had sent nudes of themselves. Ten percent stated they had exchanged intimacy for favors like presents or entry to parties; the intimacy act was spelled out as oral sex, hand job or sexual intercourse (vaginal penetration). Sugar-dating and knowledge hereof were associated with sexual debut but was not exclusively performed by debutants. Of those who gave sexual favors, 40\% were non-debutant pupils.
Conclusion: The survey found a 10 \% prevalence of sugar-dating and 53 \% receiving nude photos amongst 9th graders. The implication of the phenomena on behavior has obvious perspectives on adolescents’ mental and physical health.},

	abstract = {Social changes have resulted in an increase of students living in households that do not include both a mother and a father, reducing the efficacy of common survey questionnaire approaches to measuring student socioeconomic status ({SES}). This paper presents two studies conducted to develop and test a new, more inclusive set of student {SES} items appropriate for students from a range of household types. In the first study, we held group interviews with 57 students in Grades 4, 8, and 12 who lived in four nontraditional household types. The study goal was, first, to understand how students thought about their household members and learn what they knew about the educational background and employment status of their caregivers and, second, to develop draft items based on these findings. In the second study, we held 51 individual cognitive interviews with a similar sample to evaluate draft item clarity and function. We found that although students may live with a broad range of family members and other adults, they understood the term caregiver to refer to a person who provides resources and support. Students found it easier to answer items when the items included the titles of their caregivers. Our results demonstrate that a customizable approach to measuring student {SES} allows more students to report information about their caregivers than the current standard of asking about mothers and fathers. We provide recommendations for student {SES} measurement and potential next steps for research on this topic.},

The questionnaire developed in this study, the Child-to-Parent Aggression Questionnaire ({CPAQ}), includes forms of physical and psychological aggression directed at both the mother and the father. It also includes open questions about the reasons for the aggressive acts. The {CPAQ} was completed by a sample of 2719 adolescents (age range: 13–18 years old, 51.4\% girls). Conﬁrmatory factor analysis supported a four-factor correlated structure (physical aggression against mother, physical aggression against father, psychological aggression against mother, and psychological aggression against father). Psychological and physical aggression against the mother was more frequent than against the father. However, there were no differences with regard to severe forms of aggression. Girls scored signiﬁcantly higher on all indicators of psychological aggression, including severe psychological aggression. Nevertheless, except for the prevalence of physical aggression against mothers, which was higher in females, there were no signiﬁcant differences in physical aggression against parents. Finally, the reasons provided by the adolescents for the aggression included both instrumental (e.g., to obtain permission to get home late and to access their computers) and reactive reasons (e.g., anger and self-defense). These ﬁndings highlight the complexity of child-to-parent aggression in adolescence.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Research finds that the attitudes of principals and teachers create an atmosphere for learning, often referred to as school climate, that influences school effectiveness. Other research shows that atmospheres of trust, shared vision, and openness create positive school climate conditions. Little is known, however, about how these climates emerge in some schools and not others. There is good theoretical reason to suspect that interpersonal relationships between principals and their teachers influence school professionals? attitudes that define the broader school climate. Theories from organizational studies, social psychology, and sociology inform hypotheses about how affective, cathectic responses from interpersonal principal?teacher relationships explain variation in school professionals? satisfaction, cohesion, and commitment levels. Research Design: Nationally representative data from the Schools and Staffing Survey, 2003?04, match principals to teachers in public elementary schools. Using structural equation modeling, relational mechanisms between principals and their teachers are identified and explain positive principal attitudes. This process is then linearly regressed to explain the effects of these relationships on teachers? attitudes. Findings: Principals? relationships with their teachers affect principals? and teachers? satisfaction, cohesion, and commitment levels. Among principals, these positive work relationships improve job satisfaction, cohesion perceptions, and commitment levels. Among teachers, substantial variation is explained directly by the relationship mechanism of principals sharing expectations with their teachers. Conclusions: School professionals? attitudes form under similar organizational conditions as those of other workers. These relationships affect the schooling environment. Because of their centrality and leadership position, particular focus is paid to role of the principal in these relationships. The relationships of principals, as the school leader, strongly and directly affect teachers? attitudes, which define the schooling climate.},

Whereas previous studies primarily have relied on confirmatory factor analyses ({CFAs}), the present study aimed to evaluate the Norwegian 22-item version of the {ECBI} intensity scale using exploratory structural equation modeling ({ESEM}), which offers more flexibility compared to traditional {CFA}. The study used data from three samples of parents with children with emerging or existing problem behaviors. Results showed that the {ESEM} model showed good fit and identified the three factors Oppositional defiant behavior, Conduct problem behavior, and Inattentive behavior. In addition, the {ESEM} approach revealed several small and significant (λ ≤ .21) cross-loadings. The results illustrated the strengths of {ESEM} over {CFA} and suggest that {ESEM} provide a useful statistical framework to evaluate the structure of {ECBI} items.

In the present study, a wide variety of items, covering a range of up-to-date technology and media usage behaviors. Sixty-six items concerning technology and media usage, along with 18 additional items assessing attitudes toward technology, were administered to two independent samples of individuals, comprising 942 participants. Factor analyses were used to create 11 usage subscales representing smartphone usage, general social media usage, Internet searching, e-mailing, media sharing, text messaging, video gaming, online friendships, Facebook friendships, phone calling, and watching television in addition to four attitude-based subscales: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, technological anxiety/dependence, and attitudes toward task-switching. All subscales showed strong reliabilities and relationships between the subscales and pre-existing measures of daily media usage and Internet addiction were as predicted. Given the reliability and validity results, the new Media and Technology Usage and Attitudes Scale was suggested as a method of measuring media and technology involvement across a variety of types of research studies either as a single 60-item scale or any subset of the 15 subscales.},

	abstract = {Objective: To provide the first explicit evaluation of the dimensionality of the total difficulties score of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ({SDQ}), a widely used measure of child mental health. We do so by validating the {SDQ} across its full range against the prevalence of clinical disorder. Method: We use two large (n = 18,415) nationally-representative surveys of children and adolescents aged 5 to 16 years in the general British population. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires were completed separately by parents, teachers, and children aged 11 to 16 years, and children also received a multi-informant clinician-rated clinical diagnosis. Approximately 7,912 children from the baseline survey were also reassessed for clinical diagnosis at 3-year follow-up. Results: Across the full range of the parent, teacher, and youth {SDQ}, children with higher total difficulty scores have greater psychopathology as judged by the prevalence of clinical disorder. This was true cross-sectionally and also in predicting to disorder status 3 years later. There was no evidence of threshold effects for the {SDQ} at either high or low scores, but rather the odds of disorder increased at a constant rate across the range (odds ratios between 1.14 and 1.28 per 1-point increase in {SDQ} score).

	abstract = {Background and aims
There is currently no cross-national validation of a scale that measures problematic social media use ({SMU}). The present study investigated and compared the psychometric properties of the social media disorder ({SMD}) scale among young adolescents from different countries.

Design
Validation study.

Setting and participants
Data came from 222 532 adolescents from 44 countries participating in the health behaviour in school-aged children ({HBSC}) survey (2017/2018). The {HBSC} survey was conducted in the European region and Canada. Participants were on average aged 13.54 years (standard deviation = 1.63) and 51.24\% were girls.

Measurement
Problematic {SMU} was measured using the nine-item {SMD} scale with dichotomous response options.

Findings
Confirmatory factor analyses ({CFA}) showed good model fit for a one-factor model across all countries (minimum comparative fit index ({CFI}) and Tucker–Lewis index ({TLI}) = 0.963 and 0.951, maximum root mean square error of approximation ({RMSEA}) and standardized root mean square residual ({SRMR}) = 0.057 and 0.060), confirming structural validity. The internal consistency of the items was adequate in all countries (minimum alpha = 0.840), indicating that the scale provides reliable scores. Multi-group {CFA} showed that the factor structure was measurement invariant across countries (Δ{CFI} = -0.010, Δ{RMSEA} = 0.003), suggesting that adolescents’ level of problematic {SMU} can be reliably compared cross-nationally. In all countries, gender and socio-economic invariance was established, and age invariance was found in 43 of 44 countries. In line with prior research, in almost all countries, problematic {SMU} related to poorer mental wellbeing (range β{STDY} = 0.193–0.924, P {\textless} 0.05) and higher intensity of online communication (range β{STDY} = 0.163–0.635, P {\textless} 0.05), confirming appropriate criterion validity.

Conclusions
The social media disorder scale appears to be suitable for measuring and comparing problematic social media use among young adolescents across many national contexts.},

This study compared a brief 12-item Gatehouse Bullying Scale ({GBS}) with items drawn from the Peer Relations Questionnaire ({PRQ}), a well-established bullying questionnaire to measure the concurrent validity of the {GBS}. Methods: Year 8 secondary school students (14 years of age) in metropolitan and regional Victoria, Australia, completed questionnaires assessing being teased, being deliberately left out, had rumors spread about oneself, and/or being physically threatened or hurt. Results: The prevalence of bullying using {GBS} and {PRQ} was 57\% and 61\%, respectively. Percent agreement between the 2 measures was high. Agreement adjusted for chance was moderate (kappa 0.5). The {GBS} had good to moderate test-retest reliability (rho 0.65). Conclusions: The {GBS} is a short, reliable tool measuring the occurrence of bullying in schools. As well as a global estimate of bullying, the {GBS} provides estimates of 2 covert and 2 overt types of bullying which can be useful for schools to better plan interventions dealing with school bullying.},

	abstract = {Student well-being has recently emerged as a critical educational agenda due to its wide-reaching benefits for students in performing better at school and later as adults. With the emergence of student well-being as a priority area in educational policy and practice, efforts to measure and monitor student well-being have increased, and so has the number of student well-being domains proposed. Presently, a lack of consensus exists about what domains are appropriate to investigate and understand student well-being, resulting in a fragmented body of work. This paper aims to clarify the construct of student well-being by summarising and mapping different conceptualisations, approaches used to measure, and domains that entail well-being. The search of multiple databases identified 33 studies published in academic journals between 1989 and 2020. There were four approaches to conceptualising student well-being found in the reviewed studies. They were: Hedonic, eudaimonic, integrative (i.e., combining both hedonic and eudaimonic), and others. Results identified eight overarching domains of student well-being: Positive emotion, (lack of) Negative emotion, Relationships, Engagement, Accomplishment, Purpose at school, Intrapersonal/Internal factors, and Contextual/External factors. Recommendations for further research are offered, including the need for more qualitative research on student well-being as perceived and experienced by students and for research to be conducted in a non-western context.},

Although researchers have traditionally focused on the benefits of experiencing an enduring sense of social connection, recent research has also begun to explore the contextual factors that shape momentary feeling of social connection. To date, however, no psychological scales have been developed to measure state social connection. To address this gap, we developed the 10-item {UBC} State Social Connection Scale ({UBC}-{SSCS}). In Study 1, we generated and refined our initial pool of items and confirmed our hypothesized factor structure in a large university sample. In Studies 2 to 3, we established several forms of validity. We provide foundational evidence that the {UBC}-{SSCS} is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing momentary feelings of social connection. Our exploratory findings also suggest that researchers can substantially increase their statistical power using state (vs. trait) measures to capture fluctuations in feelings of social connection.},

	abstract = {Teacher Engagement Report Form-New ({TERF}-N; Hart, Stewart, \& Jimerson, 2011) was developed to assess teachers’ impressions of three indicators (i.e., Affective, Behavioral, and Cognitive) of student engagement. The {TERF}-N is a revision of an original teacher report, the Teacher Engagement Report Form-Original ({TERF}-O; Lam \& Jimerson, 2008) developed as part of an international collaboration. The {TERF}-N was developed because the authors anticipated there were indicators of engagement that were not measured by the {TERF}-O. The {TERF}-N is a 10-item, paper-and-pencil chart, where the teacher fills in 10 boxes, one for each item, per student. Each item is completed using a Likert-type scale of 1-5 (e.g., 1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The {TERF}-N requires approximately 45 minutes to complete for 30 students. Utilizing a sample of U.S. seventh- through ninth-grade students and their teachers, psychometric analyses of the {TERF}-N were conducted. The data for the {TERF}-N indicated good internal consistency (α = .83) between the 10 items. Factor analysis yielded an optimum one-factor solution, titled General Engagement. Indicative of external validity, there were significant correlations between the Student Engagement in Schools Questionnaire ({SESQ}; Hart, Stewart \& Jimerson, 2011) Affective and Behavioral Engagement composites and the overall {TERF}-N scores.

While some in the mainstream {AI} community dismiss the issue, I will argue that the problem is real: we have to work out how to design {AI} systems that are far more powerful than ourselves while ensuring that they never have power over us. I believe the technical aspects of this problem are solvable. Whereas the standard model of {AI} proposes to build machines that optimize known, exogenously specified objectives, a preferable approach would be to build machines that are of provable benefit to humans.

	shorttitle = {Modeling Common Ground},
	abstract = {Communication is a dynamic process through which individuals establish and refine their shared understanding, known as common ground. Common ground consists of the mutual knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions that facilitate effective interactions. It can be classified into two primary types: personal common ground, which is the knowledge or experiences shared through direct interactions or a shared history between individuals, and communal common ground, which is the general knowledge shared by individuals due to their membership in the same community, culture, or group. The evolution of common ground occurs through two fundamental mechanisms—alignment and negotiation—allowing individuals to reconcile divergent beliefs and expand their shared understanding. Despite its significance in human communication, modeling common ground computationally poses several challenges, including its dynamic nature, multimodal manifestations, and subjective interpretations.
This thesis investigates the computational representation of common ground and proposes models that infer and utilize it across different modalities. First, a Representational Theory-of-Mind framework is introduced to model belief updates and predict the emergence of common ground in video-based gaze communication. Second, an extension of this framework is applied to dyadic dialogues, integrating explicit mind inference mechanisms into language models to enhance common ground alignment and negotiation. Third, the thesis explores the emergence of graphical conventions as a form of communal common ground, employing reinforcement learning to simulate visual communication games and analyze the evolution of linguistic properties in graphical representations.
By advancing computational models of common ground, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of how shared knowledge is dynamically constructed and offers insights into the integration of artificial intelligence systems into human communicative environments.},

	abstract = {I argue that any attempt to define creative ideas cannot fully succeed without also defining uncreative ideas. This argument begins by defining three parameters that characterize a potentially creative thought: the idea's initial probability (p), the final utility (u), and the creator's prior knowledge of that utility (v). The three parameters then lead to a three-criterion multiplicative definition of personal creativity, namely, c = (1 − p)u(1 − v), where the first factor indicates originality and the third factor surprise. Although creativity can only maximize as originality, utility, and surprise all approach unity, the same definition indicates that there are seven different ways that creativity can minimize. These alternatives were identified as (a) routine, reproductive, or habitual ideas, (b) fortuitous response bias, (c) irrational perseveration, (d) problem finding, (e) rational suppression, (f) irrational suppression, and (g) blissful ignorance. If the third parameter v is omitted, then the number of creative and noncreative outcomes reduces to just four, making creativity indistinguishable from irrational suppression. The alternative outcomes are then illustrated using the classic two-string problem. Besides providing a more finely differentiated conception of creativity failures, the definition has critical implications regarding the processes and procedures required to generate highly creative ideas.},

Studies reviewed here indicate that {LLM} based systems are performing on the {AUT} at near or somewhat above human levels in terms of scores on originality and usefulness. Moreover, similar patterns are found in the data of humans and {LLM} models in the {AUT}, such as output order effects and a negative association between originality and value or utility.

	abstract = {Objective
This study was designed to investigate the revised and short version of the smartphone addiction scale and the proof of its validity in adolescents. In addition, it suggested cutting off the values by gender in order to determine smartphone addiction and elaborate the characteristics of smartphone usage in adolescents.

Method
A set of questionnaires were provided to a total of 540 selected participants from April to May of 2013. The participants consisted of 343 boys and 197 girls, and their average age was 14.5 years old. The content validity was performed on a selection of shortened items, while an internal-consistency test was conducted for the verification of its reliability. The concurrent validity was confirmed using {SAS}, {SAPS} and {KS}-scale. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was conducted to suggest cut-off.

Results
The 10 final questions were selected using content validity. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of {SAS} were verified with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.911. The {SAS}-{SV} was significantly correlated with the {SAS}, {SAPS} and {KS}-scale. The {SAS}-{SV} scores of gender (p{\textless}.001) and self-evaluation of smartphone addiction (p{\textless}.001) showed significant difference. The {ROC} analysis results showed an area under a curve ({AUC}) value of 0.963(0.888–1.000), a cut-off value of 31, sensitivity value of 0.867 and specificity value of 0.893 in boys while an {AUC} value of 0.947(0.887–1.000), a cut-off value of 33, sensitivity value of 0.875, and a specificity value of 0.886 in girls.

Conclusions
The {SAS}-{SV} showed good reliability and validity for the assessment of smartphone addiction. The smartphone addiction scale short version, which was developed and validated in this study, could be used efficiently for the evaluation of smartphone addiction in community and research areas.},

The present research examines the psychometric properties and factor structure of Maslach, Jackson and Leiter's (1996) educators' burnout measure, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Educators Survey ({MBI}-{ES}), in a sample of 771 Greek Cypriot teachers. Results, using exploratory and confirmatory factor analytic techniques, support the three factor structure of the construct which was tested against alternative models. Other psychometric qualities are also very satisfactory. Findings are compared to the published normative data for the {MBI}. Female teachers appear more emotionally exhausted than their male counterparts. Primary school teachers scored higher on emotional exhaustion, but depersonalization was higher among secondary school teachers. Overall, the results suggest that the Greek {MBI} represents a valid and reliable adaptation of the instrument, which can be confidently used to measure burnout.

	shorttitle = {Student perspectives on banning mobile phones in South Australian secondary schools},
	abstract = {Background: There has been a global trend to ban mobile phones in schools, with the aim of reducing distraction, improving focus on learning, and increasing prosocial behaviour. Survey evidence suggests tentatively that bans may increase academic performance and reduce bullying. However, an understudied but important aspect of understanding the impact of phone bans is students’ personal views on, and experiences of, these policies. To address this gap, this study investigated students’ perspectives on the benefits and challenges related to phone bans in schools.
Methods: This study was a preregistered policy experiment conducted across five secondary schools in South Australia. A total of 1549 students provided 7188 responses to open-ended survey questions.
Results: Thematic analysis of 69,589 words identified five categories with 16 themes. In terms of undesired effects of the bans, students reported: (i) feeling less independent and trustworthy, (ii) losing access to digital learning tools, and (iii) difficulties in regulating emotional distress without phones. However, students also reported benefits in areas of: (i) face-to-face social interaction, (ii) personal health and safety, and (ii) classroom engagement. Some students expressed a desire for education on responsible phone use, as well as approaches to managing digital devices with flexibility and personal agency, as an alternative to banning phones outright.
Conclusions: These findings underscore the urgent need to monitor and address students’ overreliance on phones for socialising, emotion regulation, and coping with mental health issues. Students contribute valuable insights to inform policies and guidelines at the nexus of digital technology and student learning and well-being.},

While some academics working in the area of educational technology have raised concerns, many others have so far failed to respond to what is a significant shift in the ongoing development of digital education. The paper considers how academic researchers and other educational technology stakeholders can respond to what might be perceived as the curtailment of some forms of digital education. In particular, the paper argues that this current turn away from digital devices offers an opportunity to advance understandings about a number of seemingly problematic issues regarding the continued use of digital technologies in schools. In particular, the paper reconsiders five such areas of concern that are associated with banning phones from school: (1) technology addition; (2) digital distraction; (3) cyberbullying; (4) surveillance capitalism; and (5) environmental sustainability of digital education.},

This has created unique challenges for teachers, school leaders, and policymakers. In this research study, we used a cross-sectional survey design to examine educator (n = 217) and student (n = 332) perspectives on students’ mobile phone use in New Zealand schools through a mixed-methods approach. The results indicate that both educators and students were in favour of regulating students’ phone use at the school level, but they were less in favour of a total ban approach. Most participants thought that students should not be allowed to have phones during class time, with rationale that centred around student learning and safety. Mobile phones were viewed as a distraction to student learning and compromised student safety through inappropriate use (e.g., photos and videos being taken at school and shared), cyberbullying, and social media-related issues. The findings of our research provide insights that are relevant to the development of educational policies around students’ mobile phone use at school and contribute to a broader understanding of the impacts of mobile phone use at school on child and youth achievement and well-being.},

We conducted a scoping review of the global literature, followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews ({PRISMA}-{ScR}) and pre-registered our protocol with the Open Science Framework ({OSF}). Our search and screening process identified 22 studies that met our inclusion criteria and shed light on our research questions: whether mobile phone use in schools impacts academic outcomes, mental health and wellbeing and cyberbullying. We found an absence of randomized controlled trials with evidence resting on a small number of studies with different designs, samples, operational definitions of mobile phone bans (i.e. partial, or complete bans) and outcome measures, making reconciliation of findings challenging. Nonetheless, we provide a synthesis of the latest evidence for decision-makers tasked with deciding for or against mobile phone bans in schools. Directions for future research are provided and practical implications for schools are discussed.},

	abstract = {The effects of smartphone use by children and young people, especially at school, are being discussed around the world. To support this discourse with scientific evidence, this systematic review is guided by the {PRISMA} framework and examines the effects of smartphone bans in schools on academic performance and social well-being. As a rapid review, it follows a streamlined methodology in order to provide a scientifically sound basis for educational policy decisions as quickly as possible. After a comprehensive database search, five research studies with quantitative results were selected and analyzed, and the effect sizes were calculated in the areas of academic performance and social behavior. The meta-analysis yielded an overall effect size of d = 0.162 (p {\textless} 0.05). Smartphone bans have a significant, but modest, effect. This is more pronounced in the domain of social well-being than in the performance domain. Smartphone bans can reduce social problems, such as bullying. The small effect on academic performance might be due to the limited number of studies and effects. We recommend that smartphone bans be introduced in schools, accompanied by educational measures, and evaluated regularly. This can improve the social climate and reduce potential distractions in the classroom. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term effects on academic performance. The aim of a smartphone ban should be to prevent the misuse of these devices, for example, as a tool for bullying classmates, and to prevent their negative impact on learning processes. Alongside the bans, responsible use of the technology and an understanding of its potential should be taught. Ideally, a level of media literacy is achieved that makes a smartphone ban superfluous.},

In addition, research has suggested that these digital distractions can negatively impact learning and performance. The prevalence and negative consequences of student digital distraction in the classroom require college instructors to proactively regulate student use of digital devices to protect the integrity of the learning environment. The present article aims to provide college instructors with a framework of strategies to curb student digital distraction. Specifically, the present article draws from the tenets of Self-Determination Theory ({SDT}) to illustrate how and why common policies and strategies intended to curb student digital distraction can inadvertently threaten students’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the classroom and, subsequently, alienate students against instructors. The article concludes by presenting evidence-based digital distraction prevention strategies that can buffer against student digital distraction without threatening students’ basic psychological needs or alienating students against their instructors.},

As people tend to form attachments to not only social partners, but inanimate targets as well, mobile devices can become important objects that provide safety and security. This could lead to separation anxiety, also known as “nomophobia”. Constant need for mobile use may result in problematic behaviors in schools, cause distraction in class, it is important to explore the students’ relationship to devices. Our study compares state anxiety level of high school students on a regular school day and on an experimental “mobile-free day”, when participants do not carry their mobile phones during classes. We hypothesized that separation from the mobiles would increase anxiety and decrease class engagement, especially in students with higher mobile attachment scores. The sample consisted of 235 secondary school students. Results of Repeated Measures {ANCOVA} showed that anxiety levels increased on the mobile-free school day, but class engagement was not affected by the experiment. Linear regression analysis revealed ‘Safe Haven’ mobile attachment to be a significant predictor of state anxiety on the mobile free school day. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed that mobile use habits linked to social media and instant message services were associated with higher anxiety scores on the mobile-free school day. Our results provide more insights on both use of mobile phones in learning environment and regarding school regulations of students’ device use.},

	abstract = {How should we evaluate the quality of generative models? Many existing metrics focus on a model's producibility, i.e. the quality and breadth of outputs it can generate. However, the actual value from using a generative model stems not just from what it can produce but whether a user with a specific goal can produce an output that satisfies that goal. We refer to this property as steerability. In this paper, we first introduce a mathematical framework for evaluating steerability independently from producibility. Steerability is more challenging to evaluate than producibility because it requires knowing a user's goals. We address this issue by creating a benchmark task that relies on one key idea: sample an output from a generative model and ask users to reproduce it. We implement this benchmark in a large-scale user study of text-to-image models and large language models. Despite the ability of these models to produce high-quality outputs, they all perform poorly on steerabilty. This suggests that we need to focus on improving the steerability of generative models. We show such improvements are indeed possible: through reinforcement learning techniques, we create an alternative steering mechanism for image models that achieves more than 2x improvement on this benchmark.},

The results indicated that the age of the teacher matters, however, not as suggested by Prensky (2001). There were no significant differences in the findings for the teachers who were less than 32 and the ones who were 33–49; however, they both significantly differed from those over 50 in mobile phone ownership and support for the use of mobile phones in the classroom as well as in their perceptions regarding the useful mobile features for school-related work and instructional barriers. In each instance, the older teachers were less likely to own smartphones, were less supportive on all items, were less enthusiastic about the features, and found the barriers to be more problematic.},

	abstract = {Accurate assessment of cyberbullying is essential for intervention planning and evaluation. Limitations to many currently available self-report measures of cyberbullying victimization include a lack of psychometric information and a limited scope (i.e., not assessing multiple electronic mediums of cybervictimization). To address these limitations, we developed and investigated the psychometric properties of a broad self-report measure of cyberbullying, the Cyberbullying Scale ({CBS}). We examined the factor structure and reliability of the {CBS} across 736 students in Grades 6 to 12 in six Northern Mississippi schools. Exploratory Factor Analysis ({EFA}) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis ({CFA}) results indicated that the structure of the {CBS} was best represented by a one-factor model. The finding of a single-factor structure suggests that cyberbullying is a unidimensional construct, which is consistent with previous research. In the current sample, the {CBS} demonstrated strong psychometric properties, including excellent internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .94) and significant positive correlations with related constructs of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Results from the present study provide initial support for the {CBS} as a measure of cybervictimization among adolescents.},

Results (N = 750) from this study demonstrate that when instructors discourage cell phone use for noninstructional reasons, students feel their autonomy has been threatened. These perceptions of freedom threat ultimately induce a reactance process, leading sequentially to negative cognitions and anger, which predict policy noncompliance. This reactance process is also predictive of students’ enactment of other uncivil classroom behaviors (i.e., instructional dissent). Theoretical implications are discussed, and practical suggestions are given for instructors hoping to increase cell phone policy compliance and limit reactance among students in the classroom.},

	abstract = {The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ({SDQ}) is a widely used child mental health questionnaire with five hypothesised subscales. There is theoretical and preliminary empirical support for combining the {SDQ}’s hypothesised emotional and peer subscales into an ‘internalizing’ subscale and the hypothesised behavioral and hyperactivity subscales into an ‘externalizing’ subscale (alongside the fifth prosocial subscale). We examine this using parent, teacher and youth {SDQ} data from a representative sample of 5–16 year olds in Britain (N = 18,222). Factor analyses generally supported second-order internalizing and externalizing factors, and the internalizing and externalizing subscales showed good convergent and discriminant validity across informants and with respect to clinical disorder. By contrast, discriminant validity was poorer between the emotional and peer subscales and between the behavioral, hyperactivity and prosocial subscales. This applied particularly to children with low scores on those subscales. We conclude that there are advantages to using the broader internalizing and externalizing {SDQ} subscales for analyses in low-risk samples, while retaining all five subscales when screening for disorder.},

However, many currently available self-report measures suffer from multiple methodological challenges that substantially hinder accurate and comprehensive measurement including the lack of specific elements of conflict identified by the literature subsequent to measure development, and a lack of rigorous empirical examination of psychometric properties. Thus, there is a need for a valid, psychometrically sound scale that can briefly capture perceptions of workplace interpersonal conflict in a contemporary work environment. The Workplace Interpersonal Conflict Scale ({WICS}) was developed to examine the frequency of conflict characteristics identified from a prior qualitative study of interpersonal conflict themes. In the current examination, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the psychometric properties of the {WICS} across 3 occupational samples including a cross-sectional study in health care (home care workers), a pre/post study in service (food service workers), and a large, diverse online sample (via {MTurk}). Results supported the 6-item {WICS} as a valid measure of workplace interpersonal conflict related to many other important workplace variables in the domains of work, health, and safety. Practical implications are presented and discussed. The {WICS} offers a promising measure that can be used in assessment, remediation, and prevention of noxious interpersonal cultures within the workplace.},

The Depression Scale ({DEPS}), consisting of 10 items, was developed and tested in primary care patients aged 18 to 64 years. Clinical assessments were made on the basis of Present State Examination interviews with 436 patients. The {DEPS} proved to be satisfactory. Increasing age and poor education had an adverse effect on the screening process, however. The sensitivity of the {DEPS} for clinical depression was 74\% and the specificity for non-depression 85\%. The sensitivity for severe depression was 84\% and the specificity for symptom-free patients 93\%.

Participants shared 936 first-hand examples of using {GenAI} in work tasks. Quantitatively, when considering both task- and user-specific factors, a user’s task-specific self-confidence and confidence in {GenAI} are predictive of whether critical thinking is enacted and the effort of doing so in {GenAI}-assisted tasks. Specifically, higher confidence in {GenAI} is associated with less critical thinking, while higher self-confidence is associated with more critical thinking. Qualitatively, {GenAI} shifts the nature of critical thinking toward information verification, response integration, and task stewardship. Our insights reveal new design challenges and opportunities for developing {GenAI} tools for knowledge work.},

An experiment with a 2 (human vs. chatbot) by 2 (low empathetic vs. high empathetic) design was conducted (N = 286). Results showed that there was no difference in the self-reported intimacy of self-disclosure between the human and chatbot conditions. Furthermore, people perceived less fear of judgment in the chatbot condition, but more trust in the human interactant compared to the chatbot interactant. Perceived anonymity was the only variable to directly impact self-disclosure intimacy. The finding that humans disclose equally intimate information to chatbots and humans is in line with the {CASA} paradigm, which states that people can react in a social manner to both computers and humans.},

	abstract = {Generative {AI}, particularly Language Models ({LMs}), has the potential to transform real-world domains with societal impact, particularly where access to experts is limited. For example, in education, training novice educators with expert guidance is important for effectiveness but expensive, creating significant barriers to improving education quality at scale. This challenge disproportionately harms students from under-served communities, who stand to gain the most from high-quality education. We introduce Tutor {CoPilot}, a novel Human-{AI} approach that leverages a model of expert thinking to provide expert-like guidance to tutors as they tutor. This study is the first randomized controlled trial of a Human-{AI} system in live tutoring, involving 900 tutors and 1,800 K-12 students from historically under-served communities. Following a preregistered analysis plan, we find that students working with tutors that have access to Tutor {CoPilot} are 4 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to master topics (p{\textless}0.01). Notably, students of lower-rated tutors experienced the greatest benefit, improving mastery by 9 p.p. We find that Tutor {CoPilot} costs only \$20 per-tutor annually. We analyze 550,000+ messages using classifiers to identify pedagogical strategies, and find that tutors with access to Tutor {CoPilot} are more likely to use high-quality strategies to foster student understanding (e.g., asking guiding questions) and less likely to give away the answer to the student. Tutor interviews highlight how Tutor {CoPilot}'s guidance helps tutors to respond to student needs, though they flag issues in Tutor {CoPilot}, such as generating suggestions that are not grade-level appropriate. Altogether, our study of Tutor {CoPilot} demonstrates how Human-{AI} systems can scale expertise in real-world domains, bridge gaps in skills and create a future where high-quality education is accessible to all students.},

We specifically addressed whether the contingent non-verbal feedback of virtual humans affects the association between interactants' social anxiety and their verbal self-disclosure. This subject was investigated across three experimental conditions where participants interacted with real human videos and virtual humans in computer-mediated interview interactions. The results demonstrated that socially anxious people revealed more information and greater intimate information about themselves when interacting with a virtual human when compared with real human video interaction, whereas less socially anxious people did not show this difference. We discuss the implication of this association between the interactional fidelity of virtual humans and social anxiety in a human interactant on the design of an embodied virtual agent for social skills' training and psychotherapy.

	abstract = {Adolescents are spending an increasing amount of their time online and connected to each other via digital technologies. Mobile device ownership and social media usage have reached unprecedented levels, and concerns have been raised that this constant connectivity is harming adolescents’ mental health. This review synthesized data from three sources: (a) narrative reviews and meta‐analyses conducted between 2014 and 2019, (b) large‐scale preregistered cohort studies and (c) intensive longitudinal and ecological momentary assessment studies, to summarize what is known about linkages between digital technology usage and adolescent mental health, with a specific focus on depression and anxiety. The review highlights that most research to date has been correlational, focused on adults versus adolescents, and has generated a mix of often conflicting small positive, negative and null associations. The most recent and rigorous large‐scale preregistered studies report small associations between the amount of daily digital technology usage and adolescents’ well‐being that do not offer a way of distinguishing cause from effect and, as estimated, are unlikely to be of clinical or practical significance. Implications for improving future research and for supporting adolescents’ mental health in the digital age are discussed.

When designed as supportive and ‘‘safe’’ interaction partners, {VHs} may improve such screenings by increasing willingness to disclose information (Gratch, Wang, Gerten, \& Fast, 2007). In health and mental health contexts, patients are often reluctant to respond honestly. In the context of health-screening interviews, we report a study in which participants interacted with a {VH} interviewer and were led to believe that the {VH} was controlled by either humans or automation. As predicted, compared to those who believed they were interacting with a human operator, participants who believed they were interacting with a computer reported lower fear of self-disclosure, lower impression management, displayed their sadness more intensely, and were rated by observers as more willing to disclose. These results suggest that automated {VHs} can help overcome a signiﬁcant barrier to obtaining truthful patient information.},

	abstract = {Automated scoring for divergent thinking ({DT}) seeks to overcome a key obstacle to creativity measurement: the effort, cost, and reliability of scoring open-ended tests. For a common test of {DT}, the Alternate Uses Task ({AUT}), the primary automated approach casts the problem as a semantic distance between a prompt and the resulting idea in a text model. This work presents an alternative approach that greatly surpasses the performance of the best existing semantic distance approaches. Our system, Ocsai, fine-tunes deep neural network-based large-language models ({LLMs}) on human-judged responses. Trained and evaluated against one of the largest collections of human-judged {AUT} responses, with 27 thousand responses collected from nine past studies, our fine-tuned large-language-models achieved up to r = 0.81 correlation with human raters, greatly surpassing current systems (r = 0.12–0.26). Further, learning transfers well to new test items and the approach is still robust with small numbers of training labels. We also compare prompt-based zero-shot and few-shot approaches, using {GPT}-3, {ChatGPT}, and {GPT}-4. This work also suggests a limit to the underlying assumptions of the semantic distance model, showing that a purely semantic approach that uses the stronger language representation of {LLMs}, while still improving on existing systems, does not achieve comparable improvements to our fine-tuned system. The increase in performance can support stronger applications and interventions in {DT} and opens the space of automated {DT} scoring to new areas for improving and understanding this branch of methods.},

Problem solutions were evaluated on several measures of creativity. Results indicate that creativity was influenced by the type of problem solved and the measure of creativity used to evaluate the solution. Furthermore, these results were obtained after controlling for the effect of ability.

In this study, we investigate through a common framework how developments in both models and user interfaces are important for empowering co-creation where the goal is to create music that communicates particular imagery or ideas (e.g., as is common for other purposeful tasks in music creation like establishing mood or creating accompanying music for another media). Our study is distinguished in that it measures communication through both composer's self-reported experiences, and how listeners evaluate this communication through the music. In an evaluation study with 26 composers creating 100+ pieces of music and listeners providing 1000+ head-to-head comparisons, we find that more expressive models and more steerable interfaces are important and complementary ways to make a difference in composers communicating through music and supporting their creative empowerment.},

Through two studies, the authors investigate nongenerative and generative {AI} applications within marketing contexts using a conceptually driven and empirically derived approach. In Study 1, the authors observe how creative individuals, particularly artists, utilize {AI} and its effects on their creative experiences, revealing {AI}'s role as (1) a new instrumental resource, (2) a tool for exploring possibilities, and (3) a means to deconstruct the creative process. Study 2 assesses 1,036 {AI} systems (2015?2021) and 241,292 {AI} models (2022?2024), categorizing them into four clusters and three levels of observed creativity. From these insights, the authors introduce a framework for {AI}-enabled creativity: (1) inspiring agile methods, (2) augmenting human creativity, and (3) inspiring unconventional thinking. Validated by three workshops, this framework equips marketing leaders with a deeper comprehension of {AI}'s creative potential. The authors advocate for {AI} integration within agile, augmented, and unconventional marketing approaches, advancing our understanding of {AI}'s contribution to marketing creativity. Additionally, they propose a research roadmap for empirical validation in real-world applications.},

In contrast, while generative {AI} excels at the {\textbackslash}textit\{generation\} of content, it often struggles to make specific language-guided {\textbackslash}textit\{modifications\} of its prior outputs. To bridge the gap between how humans and machines perform edits, we present {mrCAD}, a dataset of multimodal instructions in a communication game. In each game, players created computer aided designs ({CADs}) and refined them over several rounds to match specific target designs. Only one player, the Designer, could see the target, and they must instruct the other player, the Maker, using text, drawing, or a combination of modalities. {mrCAD} consists of 6,082 communication games, 15,163 instruction-execution rounds, played between 1,092 pairs of human players. We analyze the dataset and find that generation and refinement instructions differ in their composition of drawing and text. Using the {mrCAD} task as a benchmark, we find that state-of-the-art {VLMs} are better at following generation instructions than refinement instructions. These results lay a foundation for analyzing and modeling a multimodal language of refinement that is not represented in previous datasets.},

In interactions with {AI}-driven chatbots, user repair addresses chatbots' lack of understanding or misunderstanding of the user's intent. This paper represents a user-centred description of user repair strategies in interactions with a task-oriented chatbot. It is based on the analysis of simulated user interactions with a chatbot facilitating health appointment bookings. The analysis shows that the repair strategies which users draw on most frequently (e.g., rephrasing) are not necessarily the ones which prompt the bot to correctly recognise intent and provide relevant responses, whereas the less frequently used self-repair strategies (e.g. restating the intent) are more successful in achieving intent recognition. This suggest that the rules of interaction with conversational {AI} need to be made explicit to users as they lack familiarity with the context, limitations and patterning of interactions facilitated through {AI}.},

	abstract = {Although bullshit is common in everyday life and has attracted attention from philosophers, its reception (critical or ingenuous) has not, to our knowledge, been subject to empirical investigation. Here we focus on pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure but no discernible meaning (e.g., “Wholeness quiets inﬁnite phenomena”). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge bullshit statements as profound was associated with a variety of conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style, supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., “A wet person does not fear the rain”) or mundane (e.g., “Newborn babies require constant attention”) statements. These results support the idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticism but rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive sounding claims. Our results also suggest that a bias toward accepting statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity.},

Across three studies (total N = 1,948), scientiﬁc bullshit receptivity was positively correlated with pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity. Both types of bullshit receptivity were positively correlated with belief in science, conservative political beliefs, and faith in intuition. However, compared to pseudoprofound bullshit receptivity, scientiﬁc bullshit receptivity was more strongly correlated with belief in science, and less strongly correlated with conservative political beliefs and faith in intuition. Finally, scientiﬁc literacy moderated the relationship the two types of bullshit receptivity; the correlation between the two types of receptivity was weaker for individuals scoring high in scientiﬁc literacy.},

We investigate the psychological profile of individuals who fall prey to fake news. Method We recruited 1,606 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk for three online surveys. Results The tendency to ascribe profundity to randomly generated sentences—pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity—correlates positively with perceptions of fake news accuracy, and negatively with the ability to differentiate between fake and real news (media truth discernment). Relatedly, individuals who overclaim their level of knowledge also judge fake news to be more accurate. We also extend previous research indicating that analytic thinking correlates negatively with perceived accuracy by showing that this relationship is not moderated by the presence/absence of the headline’s source (which has no effect on accuracy), or by familiarity with the headlines (which correlates positively with perceived accuracy of fake and real news). Conclusion Our results suggest that belief in fake news may be driven, to some extent, by a general tendency to be overly accepting of weak claims. This tendency, which we refer to as reflexive open-mindedness, may be partly responsible for the prevalence of epistemically suspect beliefs writ large.},

If correct, that would make large language models distinctively dangerous discourse participants. Bullshitters not only undermine the norm of truthfulness (by saying false things) but the normative status of truth itself (by treating it as entirely irrelevant). So, do large language models really bullshit? I argue that they can, in the sense of issuing propositional content in response to fact-seeking prompts, without having first assessed that content for truth or falsity. However, I further argue that they need not bullshit, given appropriate guardrails. So, just as with human speakers, the propensity for a large language model to bullshit depends on its own particular make-up.},

Computer-generated art sells for millions at auctions; artists routinely use algorithms to generate aesthetic materials. However, to capture the impact of such works and our relationships with them, we need to better understand the kinds of responses we make to {AI}/computer-generated images. Here, we consider whether and, if so, to what extent humans report feeling emotions when engaging computer-generated art, or even ascribe intentionality behind those feelings. These are emerging—and also long-standing—points of controversy, with critical arguments that this should not occur, thus marking potential distinctions between artificial and ‘real’ human productions. We tested this by employing visually similar abstract, black-and-white artworks, made by a computer ({RNG}) or by human artists intentionally aiming at transmitting emotions. In a 2 × 2 design, participants (N = 48) viewed the art, preceded by primes about human/computer provenance (true, 50\% of cases). Contrary to critical suggestions, participants almost always not only reported emotions but also ascribed intentionality, independent of the prime given. Interestingly, they did report stronger emotions when the work actually was made by a human. We discuss implications for our understanding of art engagements and future developments regarding computer-generated digital interactions.},

In two experiments (N?=?176 and N?=?381) we observed negative indirect effects of artist information ({AI} vs human artist) on the appreciation of visual artworks. The {AI} is consistently ascribed less agency and less experience than a human artist. Higher levels of experience and agency ascribed to an artist are, in turn, associated with higher appreciation of a piece of art. In both experiments the total effect of artist information on appreciation was not significant. Artist information did not predict whether the artwork deviated positively from viewers? expectations developed before the actual artwork was encountered.},

Using different perceptual methods (categorization, matching, and rating), as well as acoustical analyses of timing and amplitude, we found that both musicians and nonmusicians could discern among the levels of expressive intent of violin, trumpet, clarinet, oboe, and piano performers. Time-contour profiles showed distinct signatures between instruments and across expressive levels, which affords a basis for perceptual discrimination. For example, for "appropriate" expressive performances, a gradual lengthening of successive durations leads to the cadence. Although synthesized versions based on performance timings led to less response accuracy than did the complete natural performance, evidence suggests that timing may be more salient as a perceptual cue than amplitude. We outline a metabolic communication theory of musical expression that is based on a system of sequences of states, and changes of state, which fill gaps of inexorable time. We assume that musical states have a flexible, topologically deformable nature. Our conception allows for hierarchies and structure in active music processing that static generative grammars do not. This theory is supported by the data, in which patterns of timings and amplitudes differed among and between instruments and levels of expression.},

We analyse 39 {AI} art evaluations from key global newspapers to answer the following questions: how is creative agency discussed, and how are the evaluations of creative outcomes affected by the understandings of creative agency? Our results demonstrate a spectrum of creative agencies, which expands from four (human-centred, {AI}-centred, co-agency, assemblage) to seven ({AI}-assisted, {AI}-enchanted, and {AI}-improvised) agencies.

The advancements of creative {AI} systems dispute the common definitions of creativity that have traditionally focused on five elements: actor, process, outcome, domain, and space. Moreover, creative workers, such as scientists and artists, increasingly use {AI} in their creative processes, and the concept of co-creativity has emerged to describe blended human–{AI} creativity. These issues evoke the question of whether creativity requires redefinition in the era of {AI}. Currently, co-creativity is mostly studied within the framework of computer science in pre-organized laboratory settings. This study contributes from a human scientific perspective with 52 interviews of Finland-based computer scientists and new media artists who use {AI} in their work. The results suggest scientists and artists use similar elements to define creativity. However, the role of {AI} differs between the scientific and artistic creative processes. Scientists need {AI} to produce accurate and trustworthy outcomes, whereas artists use {AI} to explore and play. Unlike the scientists, some artists also considered their work with {AI} co-creative. We suggest that co-creativity can explain the contemporary creative processes in the era of {AI} and should be the focal point of future creativity research.},

Four experiments (N = 1708), including a high-powered preregistered experiment, consistently reveal a pervasive bias against {AI}-made artworks and shed light on its psychological underpinnings. The same artwork is preferred less when labeled as {AI}-made (vs. human-made) because it is perceived as less creative and subsequently induces less awe, an emotional response typically associated with the aesthetic appreciation of art. These effects are more pronounced among people with stronger anthropocentric creativity beliefs (i.e., who believe that creativity is a uniquely human characteristic). Systematic depreciation of {AI}-made art (assignment of lower creative value, suppression of emotional reactions) appears to serve a shaken anthropocentric worldview whereby creativity is exclusively reserved for humans.},

Although creative achievement is influenced by many variables, the basis for creativity is held to lie in the generation of high-quality, original, and elegant solutions to complex, novel, ill-defined problems. In the present effort, we examine the cognitive capacities that make creative problem-solving possible. We argue that creative problem-solving depends on the effective execution of a set of complex cognitive processes. Effective execution of these processes is, in turn, held to depend on the strategies employed in process execution and the knowledge being used in problem-solving.

Results show good internal consistency in both groups, but test–retest data were variable across populations and test–retest intervals. Validity analysis showed that the {CDI} distinguished Ss with general emotional distress from normal schoolchildren. However, differences between {CDI} scores of depressed ({DSM}-{III}) and nondepressed Ss were not significant. There was a good correspondence between the {CDI} and self-report measures of self-concept. It is suggested that the {CDI} measures a multidimensional construct that overlaps with other childhood disorders (particularly anxiety).

            Free associations have been extensively used in psychology and linguistics for studying how conceptual knowledge is organized. Recently, the potential of applying a similar approach for investigating the knowledge encoded in {LLMs} has emerged, specifically as a method for investigating {LLM} biases. However, the absence of large-scale {LLM}-generated free association norms that are comparable with human-generated norms is an obstacle to this research direction. To address this, we create a new dataset of {LLM}-generated free association norms modeled after the “Small World of Words”({SWOW}) human-generated norms with nearly 12,000 cue words. We prompt three {LLMs} (Mistral, Llama3, and Haiku) with the same cues as those in {SWOW} to generate three novel comparable datasets, the “{LLM} World of Words” ({LWOW}). From the datasets, we construct network models of semantic memory that represent the conceptual knowledge possessed by humans and {LLMs}. We validate the datasets by simulating semantic priming within the network models, and we briefly discuss how the datasets can be used for investigating implicit biases in humans and {LLMs}.},

Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: As {LLMs} become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two measures: {LLM} Word Association Test, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and {LLM} Relative Decision Test, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in contextual decisions. Both measures are based on psychological research: {LLM} Word Association Test adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and {LLM} Relative Decision Test operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). These prompt-based measures draw from psychology’s long history of research into measuring stereotypes based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned {LLMs} that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.},

            Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides indirect access to an underlying level of conceptual structure. To what degree this conceptual structure is universal or is due to properties of cultural histories, or to the environment inhabited by a speech community, is still controversial. Meaning is notoriously difficult to measure, let alone parameterize, for quantitative comparative studies. Using cross-linguistic dictionaries across languages carefully selected as an unbiased sample reflecting the diversity of human languages, we provide an empirical measure of semantic relatedness between concepts. Our analysis uncovers a universal structure underlying the sampled vocabulary across language groups independent of their phylogenetic relations, their speakers’ culture, and geographic environment.

            How universal is human conceptual structure? The way concepts are organized in the human brain may reflect distinct features of cultural, historical, and environmental background in addition to properties universal to human cognition. Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides indirect access to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously difficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here, we provide an empirical measure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic dictionaries to translate words to and from languages carefully selected to be representative of worldwide diversity. These translations reveal cases where a particular language uses a single “polysemous” word to express multiple concepts that another language represents using distinct words. We use the frequency of such polysemies linking two concepts as a measure of their semantic proximity and represent the pattern of these linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly structured: Certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than others, and naturally interpretable clusters of closely related concepts emerge. Statistical analysis of the polysemies observed in a subset of the basic vocabulary shows that these structural properties are consistent across different language groups, and largely independent of geography, environment, and the presence or absence of a literary tradition. The methods developed here can be applied to any semantic domain to reveal the extent to which its conceptual structure is, similarly, a universal attribute of human cognition and language use.},

	abstract = {Flexibility of thought is theorized to play a critical role in the ability of high creative individuals to generate novel and innovative ideas. However, this has been examined only through indirect behavioral measures. Here we use network percolation analysis (removal of links in a network whose strength is below an increasing threshold) to computationally examine the robustness of the semantic memory networks of low and high creative individuals. Robustness of a network indicates its flexibility and thus can be used to quantify flexibility of thought as related to creativity. This is based on the assumption that the higher the robustness of the semantic network, the higher its flexibility. Our analysis reveals that the semantic network of high creative individuals is more robust to network percolation compared with the network of low creative individuals and that this higher robustness is related to differences in the structure of the networks. Specifically, we find that this higher robustness is related to stronger links connecting between different components of similar semantic words in the network, which may also help to facilitate spread of activation over their network. Thus, we directly and quantitatively examine the relation between flexibility of thought and creative ability. Our findings support the associative theory of creativity, which posits that high creative ability is related to a flexible structure of semantic memory. Finally, this approach may have further implications, by enabling a quantitative examination of flexibility of thought, in both healthy and clinical populations.},

	abstract = {Products and services labeled as {AI}-created are perceived differently than identical ones attributed to humans, reflecting the phenomenon of algorithm aversion. This perception gap is partly explained by individuals’ tendency to attribute lower effort and creativity to work produced by {AI} algorithms. Through two pre-registered experiments, we investigate how individuals evaluate creative content when it is labeled as created by {AI}, humans, or human-{AI} collaboration. While previous research has established algorithm aversion across various domains, our findings reveal nuanced patterns in creative contexts. Individuals consistently rate content labeled as {AI}-authored as less creative and less favorable compared to content labeled as human-authored. This effect is driven by a sequential mediation: perceived effort influences perceived creativity, which in turn shapes overall attitudes. Importantly, content labeled as human-{AI} collaboration performs significantly better than {AI}-only content, suggesting a potential mitigation strategy. Our main theoretical contribution is the identification of the machine heuristic ({MH}), individuals' preexisting beliefs about {AI} capabilities, as a key moderator. Individuals with stronger {MH} beliefs attribute more effort to {AI}-generated work, which positively influences perceptions of creativity along with behavioral intentions. Using Netflix show descriptions as stimuli, we show these effects extend beyond attitudes to impact behavioral outcomes like willingness to watch. These results expand algorithm aversion theory by establishing {MH} as an important boundary condition and highlighting human-{AI} collaboration as an effective mitigation approach, offering valuable insights for creative industries integrating {AI} while maintaining positive perceptions among users.},

In Sokoban, players navigate a grid world, pushing boxes onto goal locations while avoiding getting stuck. We first analyzed natural game play statistics (n = 442 puzzles) and found that some variation in enjoyment ratings could be jointly predicted by surface-level features (e.g., puzzle area) and solution complexity. Next, we measured how much participants reported enjoying a puzzle immediately after attempting it (N = 250 participants). We found that on successful attempts, participants enjoyed it more when they took fewer moves, whereas when unsuccessful, having made more moves was associated with greater enjoyment. Together, these studies advance understanding of how both features of the task environment and the dynamics of exploration make some activities more fun than others.},

Along with its potential benefits, it is imperative that we examine pitfalls in how generative {AI} may affect the quality of creative thinking and possibly lead to a narrowing of diversity both in representation and thought. In this study, we employed an experimental design with 225 university students who completed a creative writing task with pre- and post-task surveys to assess {ChatGPT}’s impact on their performance and experiences compared to a control group who did not use {ChatGPT}. Results show that using {ChatGPT} enhanced creativity of output and reduced the difficulty and effort required for the task, particularly for nonnative English speakers. However, it also diminished the value and enjoyment of the task and raised moral concerns. We contribute to the nascent literature on {GenAI} by showing how {ChatGPT} assistance could potentially bolster human creativity by facilitating content delivery or providing useful counterpoint ideas. We also significantly advance scholarship on understanding experience of {GenAI}, demonstrating that bypassing the cognitive effort required for creativity by using {ChatGPT} could be harmful to the creative process and experience of creative tasks, especially when steps are not taken to address the use of {AI} in a transparent manner. Finally, our novel mixed-method study design offers a contribution to the methodological frameworks for the study of the effects and experience of {GenAI}. We discuss the study results in relation to implications for educational practices and social policy and argue that our results support recommending an integration of generative {AI} into higher education alongside practices that help to mitigate the negative impacts of {AI} use on student experience.},

	abstract = {Background
There has been a global trend to ban mobile phones in schools, with the aim of reducing distraction, improving focus on learning, and increasing prosocial behaviour. Survey evidence suggests tentatively that bans may increase academic performance and reduce bullying. However, an understudied but important aspect of understanding the impact of phone bans is students' personal views on, and experiences of, these policies. To address this gap, this study investigated students' perspectives on the benefits and challenges related to phone bans in schools.
Methods
This study was a preregistered policy experiment conducted across five secondary schools in South Australia. A total of 1549 students provided 7188 responses to open-ended survey questions.
Results
Thematic analysis of 69,589 words identified five categories with 16 themes. In terms of undesired effects of the bans, students reported: (i) feeling less independent and trustworthy, (ii) losing access to digital learning tools, and (iii) difficulties in regulating emotional distress without phones. However, students also reported benefits in areas of: (i) face-to-face social interaction, (ii) personal health and safety, and (ii) classroom engagement. Some students expressed a desire for education on responsible phone use, as well as approaches to managing digital devices with flexibility and personal agency, as an alternative to banning phones outright.
Conclusions
These findings underscore the urgent need to monitor and address students’ overreliance on phones for socialising, emotion regulation, and coping with mental health issues. Students contribute valuable insights to inform policies and guidelines at the nexus of digital technology and student learning and well-being.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge in Artiﬁcial Intelligence ({AI}) tools that allow creators to develop melodies, harmonies, lyrics, and mixes with the touch of a button. The reception of and discussion on the use of these tools - and more broadly, any {AI}-based art creation tools - tend to be polarizing, with opinions ranging from enthusiasm about their potential to fear about how these tools will impact the livelihood and creativity of human creators. However, a more desirable future path is most likely somewhere in between these two polar opposites where productive and ethical human-{AI} collaboration could happen through the use of these tools. To explore this possibility, we ﬁrst need to improve our understanding of how music creators perceive and utilize these types of tools in their creative process. We conducted case studies of a range of music creators to better understand their perception and usage of {AI}-based music creation tools. Through a thematic analysis of these cases, we identify the opportunities and challenges related to the use of {AI} for music creation from the perspective of the musicians and discuss the design implications for {AI} music tools.},

However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textbackslash}textasciitilde65 hours) with {BERT}. The construction of {BERT} makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-{BERT} ({SBERT}), a modification of the pretrained {BERT} network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with {BERT} / {RoBERTa} to about 5 seconds with {SBERT}, while maintaining the accuracy from {BERT}. We evaluate {SBERT} and {SRoBERTa} on common {STS} tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

Along with its potential benefits, it is imperative that we examine pitfalls in how generative {AI} may affect the quality of creative thinking and possibly lead to a narrowing of diversity both in representation and thought. In this study, we employed an experimental design with 225 university students who completed a creative writing task with pre- and post-task surveys to assess {ChatGPT}'s impact on their performance and experiences compared to a control group who did not use {ChatGPT}. Results show that using {ChatGPT} enhanced creativity of output and reduced the difficulty and effort required for the task, particularly for non-native English speakers. However, it also diminished the value and enjoyment of the task and raised moral concerns. We contribute to the nascent literature on {GenAI} by showing how {ChatGPT} assistance could potentially bolster human creativity by facilitating content delivery or providing useful counterpoint ideas. We also significantly advance scholarship on understanding experience of {GenAI}, demonstrating that bypassing the cognitive effort required for creativity by using {ChatGPT} could be harmful to the creative process and experience of creative tasks, especially when steps are not taken to address the use of {AI} in a transparent manner. Finally, our novel mixed-method study design offers a contribution to the methodological frameworks for the study of the effects and experience of {GenAI}. We discuss the study results in relation to implications for educational practices and social policy and argue that our results support recommending an integration of generative {AI} into higher education alongside practices that help to mitigate the negative impacts of {AI} use on student experience.},

Five studies (N = 5111) demonstrate this “{AI} Effect.” Study 1 first establishes a two-part classification of human attributes used in subsequent studies, distinguishing human attributes that {AI} are perceived as capable of (“shared” attributes such as using logic or language) from ones that humans are seen as uniquely capable of (“distinctive” attributes such as having a personality or beliefs). Study 2 demonstrates the {AI} Effect: compared to reading an article about the attributes of trees, reading an article describing {AI} advances leads participants to rate distinctive attributes as more essential to being human. Study 3 tests whether this effect is due to anthropomorphizing a non-human entity. Study 4 considers the alternative that this effect is solely driven by demand. Study 5 shows that it is enough to simply mention {AI} advances to observe this effect. This research suggests that as people learn about increasingly sophisticated {AI}, conceptions of human nature may shift in reaction to regard what makes humans unique as more essential.},

	abstract = {In this paper we argue that key, often sensational and misleading, claims regarding linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models ({LLMs}) are based on at least two unfounded assumptions; the assumption of language completeness and the assumption of data completeness. Language completeness assumes that a distinct and complete thing such as `a natural language' exists, the essential characteristics of which can be effectively and comprehensively modelled by an {LLM}. The assumption of data completeness relies on the belief that a language can be quantified and wholly captured by data. Work within the enactive approach to cognitive science makes clear that, rather than a distinct and complete thing, language is a means or way of acting. Languaging is not the kind of thing that can admit of a complete or comprehensive modelling. From an enactive perspective we identify three key characteristics of enacted language; embodiment, participation, and precariousness, that are absent in {LLMs}, and likely incompatible in principle with current architectures. We argue that these absences imply that {LLMs} are not now and cannot in their present form be linguistic agents the way humans are. We illustrate the point in particular through the phenomenon of `algospeak', a recently described pattern of high stakes human language activity in heavily controlled online environments. On the basis of these points, we conclude that sensational and misleading claims about {LLM} agency and capabilities emerge from a deep misconception of both what human language is and what {LLMs} are.},

While previous work has explored large language model ({LLM}) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in {LLMs} and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying {LLMs}' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new {BullshitEval} benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 {AI} assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback ({RLHF}) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought ({CoT}) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our findings highlight systematic challenges in {AI} alignment and provide new insights toward more truthful {LLM} behavior.},

Although some studies have corroborated this hypothesis and proposed explanations for its existence, the evidence on both fronts has been mixed and open to debate. We first review the literature to ascertain whether the uncanny valley exists. We then try to explain the uncanny phenomenon by reviewing hypotheses derived from diverse theoretical and methodological perspectives within psychology and allied fields, including evolutionary, social, cognitive, and psychodynamic approaches. Next, we provide an evaluation and critique of these studies by focusing on their methodological limitations, leading us to question the accepted definition of the uncanny valley. We examine the definitions of human likeness and likability, and propose a statistical test to preliminarily quantify their nonlinear relation. We argue that the uncanny valley hypothesis is ultimately an engineering problem that bears on the possibility of building androids that may some day become indistinguishable from humans. In closing, we propose a dehumanization hypothesis to explain the uncanny phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Following the widespread adoption of {ChatGPT} in early 2023, numerous studies reported that large language models ({LLMs}) can match or even surpass human performance in creative tasks. However, it remains unclear whether {LLMs} have become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In this study, we evaluated 14 widely used {LLMs} -- including {GPT}-4, Claude, Llama, Grok, Mistral, and {DeepSeek} -- across two validated creativity assessments: the Divergent Association Task ({DAT}) and the Alternative Uses Task ({AUT}). Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over the past 18-24 months, with {GPT}-4 performing worse than in previous studies. For the more widely used {AUT}, all models performed on average better than the average human, with {GPT}-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28\% of {LLM}-generated responses reached the top 10\% of human creativity benchmarks. Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model variability: the same {LLM}, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability risks misjudging the creative potential of {LLMs}, either inflating or underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected {LLMs} differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and repeated assessment when using Generative {AI} ({GenAI}) tools in creative contexts.},

We found that using {ChatGPT} increased the creativity of the generated ideas compared with not using any technology or using a conventional Web search (Google). This effect remained robust regardless of whether the problem required consideration of many (versus few) constraints and whether it was viewed as requiring empathetic concern. Furthermore, {ChatGPT} was most effective at generating incrementally (versus radically) new ideas. Process evidence suggests that the positive influence of {ChatGPT} can be attributed to its capability to combine remotely related concepts into a cohesive form, leading to a more articulate presentation of ideas.},

Each participant submitted one idea, which external evaluators rated on multiple creativity dimensions, including innovativeness and usefulness. Across tasks, instructing participants to use {ChatGPT} enhanced the average creativity of ideas, outperforming web searches and unaided human intuition, with creativity measured as the average of aggregated scores of originality (original, innovative, creative) and appropriateness (practical, effective, useful). These results strengthen the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of {LLMs} in idea generation, contributing to a rapidly growing literature.

	abstract = {As algorithms are increasingly applied to screen applicants for high-stakes decisions in employment, lending, and other domains, concerns have been raised about the effects of algorithmic monoculture, in which many decision-makers all rely on the same algorithm. This concern invokes analogies to agriculture, where a monocultural system runs the risk of severe harm from unexpected shocks. Here, we show that the dangers of algorithmic monoculture run much deeper, in that monocultural convergence on a single algorithm by a group of decision-making agents, even when the algorithm is more accurate for any one agent in isolation, can reduce the overall quality of the decisions being made by the full collection of agents. Unexpected shocks are therefore not needed to expose the risks of monoculture; it can hurt accuracy even under “normal” operations and even for algorithms that are more accurate when used by only a single decision-maker. Our results rely on minimal assumptions and involve the development of a probabilistic framework for analyzing systems that use multiple noisy estimates of a set of alternatives.},

Adding explanations to the {AI} decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual {AI} recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the {AI} suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the {AI}-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable {AI} approaches and to a no-{AI} baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable {AI} approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable {AI} solutions.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that large language model ({LLM})-powered conversational agents often exhibit `sycophancy', a tendency to adapt their responses to align with user perspectives, even at the expense of factual accuracy. However, users' perceptions of {LLM} sycophancy and its interplay with other anthropomorphic features (e.g., friendliness) in shaping user trust remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we conducted a 2 (Sycophancy: presence vs. absence) x 2 (Friendliness: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment (N = 224). Our study uncovered, for the first time, the intricate dynamics between {LLM} sycophancy and friendliness: When an {LLM} agent already exhibits a friendly demeanor, being sycophantic reduces perceived authenticity, thereby lowering user trust; Conversely, when the agent is less friendly, aligning its responses with user opinions makes it appear more genuine, leading to higher user trust. Our findings entail profound implications for {AI} persuasion through exploiting human psychological tendencies and highlight the imperative for responsible designs in user-{LLM} agent interactions.},

We document the growth of {ChatGPT}’s consumer product from its launch in November 2022 through July 2025, when it had been adopted by around 10\% of the world’s adult population. Early adopters were disproportionately male but the gender gap has narrowed dramatically, and we find higher growth rates in lower-income countries. Using a privacy-preserving automated pipeline, we classify usage patterns within a representative sample of {ChatGPT} conversations. We find steady growth in work-related messages but even faster growth in non-work-related messages, which have grown from 53\% to more than 70\% of all usage. Work usage is more common for educated users in highly-paid professional occupations. We classify messages by conversation topic and find that “Practical Guidance,” “Seeking Information,” and “Writing” are the three most common topics and collectively account for nearly 80\% of all conversations. Writing dominates work-related tasks, highlighting chatbots’ unique ability to generate digital outputs compared to traditional search engines. Computer programming and self-expression both represent relatively small shares of use. Overall, we find that {ChatGPT} provides economic value through decision support, which is especially important in knowledge-intensive jobs.},

However, as research expands the knowledge base regarding the capabilities and performance of this technology, the prevailing view is shifting away from “{AI} is creative” and towards a more balanced model of Human-{AI} co-creativity. Nevertheless, even this paradigm may be impacted by untested assumptions: for example, that generative {AI} will boost human performance on idea generation tasks. To test that assumption this study primed subjects with lists of words purportedly either from a human or from {ChatGPT}, and of varying degrees of creativity. Subjects then completed the Divergent Association Task ({DAT}). The results of this study found no evidence of any difference in divergent thinking resulting from either the source of priming (Human/{ChatGPT}) or from the level of creativity of the priming (low, typical, and high), with one exception: a low-creativity prime, believed to be from {ChatGPT}, resulted in lower scores on the {DAT} compared to other priming conditions. A subsequent regression analysis supported this result, finding only the perceived creativity of the prime to be a weak predictor of {DAT} scores (in addition to the expected trait of Openness).

	abstract = {Abstract
            As artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models ({LLMs}), become increasingly integrated into decision-making processes, the ability to trust their outputs is crucial. To earn human trust, {LLMs} must be well calibrated such that they can accurately assess and communicate the likelihood of their predictions being correct. Whereas recent work has focused on {LLMs}’ internal confidence, less is understood about how effectively they convey uncertainty to users. Here we explore the calibration gap, which refers to the difference between human confidence in {LLM}-generated answers and the models’ actual confidence, and the discrimination gap, which reflects how well humans and models can distinguish between correct and incorrect answers. Our experiments with multiple-choice and short-answer questions reveal that users tend to overestimate the accuracy of {LLM} responses when provided with default explanations. Moreover, longer explanations increased user confidence, even when the extra length did not improve answer accuracy. By adjusting {LLM} explanations to better reflect the models’ internal confidence, both the calibration gap and the discrimination gap narrowed, significantly improving user perception of {LLM} accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of accurate uncertainty communication and highlight the effect of explanation length in influencing user trust in artificial-intelligence-assisted decision-making environments.},

To measure the creativity of {LLMs} holistically, the current study uses thirteen creative tasks spanning three domains. We benchmark the {LLMs} against individual humans, and also take a novel approach by comparing them to the collective creativity of groups of humans. We find that the best {LLMs} (Claude and {GPT}-4) rank in the 52nd percentile against humans, and overall {LLMs} excel in divergent thinking and problem solving but lag in creative writing. We also show that the collective creativity in 10 {LLM} responses is equivalent to 8–10 humans. When there are more than 10 {LLM} responses, in terms of incremental collective creativity, two additional {LLM} responses equal one extra human. Ultimately, {LLMs}, when optimally applied, may compete with a small group of humans in the future of work.},

In a question-answering task, participants report higher ratings of internal knowledge confidence accompanying immediate access to Featured Snippets than those with delayed or no access to Featured Snippets. The effects of immediate information access on knowledge confidence not only occur for specific topics for which relevant information has been retrieved but also for topics irrelevant to the retrieved information. When people have immediate access to explanations through features that enhance access to information, external retrieval fluency may serve as a heuristic for internal knowledge confidence.

This Review synthesizes evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how {LLMs} reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.},

The creative industries discourse instrumentalises and dehumanises creativity by hiding labour perspectives and treating creativity as human capital and a generator of {IP}. Meanwhile, contemplating {AI} creativity helps us to look beyond the economic paradigm and consider key traits of human creativity and the creation process, some aspects of which are successfully emulated by {AI}. Yet, we also observe how {AI} dissociates creativity from human agency and how its cost-cutting effect can challenge human creators in many sectors. Finally, the idea of everyday creativity effectively rehumanises and democratises creativity; however, it not only lacks labour perspectives but also hinders them.},

	abstract = {We introduce \{{\textbackslash}em generative monoculture\}, a behavior observed in large language models ({LLMs}) characterized by a significant narrowing of model output diversity relative to available training data for a given task: for example, generating only positive book reviews for books with a mixed reception. While in some cases, generative monoculture enhances performance (e.g., {LLMs} more often produce efficient code), the dangers are exacerbated in others (e.g., {LLMs} refuse to share diverse opinions). As {LLMs} are increasingly used in high-impact settings such as education and web search, careful maintenance of {LLM} output diversity is essential to ensure a variety of facts and perspectives are preserved over time. We experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of generative monoculture through analysis of book review and code generation tasks, and find that simple countermeasures such as altering sampling or prompting strategies are insufficient to mitigate the behavior. Moreover, our results suggest that the root causes of generative monoculture are likely embedded within the {LLM}'s alignment processes, suggesting a need for developing fine-tuning paradigms that preserve or promote diversity.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive, in-depth review of ideation assisted by large language models ({LLMs}), highlighting emerging trends and identifying unaddressed research gaps. In total, we examined 61 studies investigating the application of {LLMs} in both group and individual ideation processes. From these studies, we derived the Hourglass Ideation Framework for {LLM}-assisted ideation, comprising three phases and seven key ideation stages, which served as the basis for our systematic survey. Our analysis reveals that {LLMs} are most frequently used for idea generation and refinement, but their use in scope specification, foundational material structuring and multi-idea evaluation and selection remains limited. We provide our findings in extensive tabular and online formats. These catalogues detail research on {LLM}-assisted, purely {LLM}-based, and human-only activities across the seven ideation stages for each of the 61 studies. These also detail creative domains, publication outlets, interaction designs, user study designs, and assessment methods. Our analysis of system interaction design reveals a predominant focus on supporting individual ideation activities and text-based interaction, with a growing trend of incorporating multimedia elements. However, in group ideation, tools and interaction modalities targeting both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration are much scarcer. We synthesize the primary findings of our review and outline promising directions for future research in {LLM}-assisted ideation. We hope this review will help researchers quickly gain an overview of this rapidly expanding area, efficiently locate relevant work, and identify underexplored areas for further investigation. In addition, we believe the framework we present here will form the basis for the development of future problem and solution space taxonomies, and methodologies for {LLM}-assisted ideation development and use.},

With the widespread adoption of {LLMs}, human gold--standard annotations are key to understanding the capabilities of {LLMs} and the validity of their results. However, crowdsourcing, an important, inexpensive way to obtain human annotations, may itself be impacted by {LLMs}, as crowd workers have financial incentives to use {LLMs} to increase their productivity and income. To investigate this concern, we conducted a case study on the prevalence of {LLM} usage by crowd workers. We reran an abstract summarization task from the literature on Amazon Mechanical Turk and, through a combination of keystroke detection and synthetic text classification, estimate that 33-46\% of crowd workers used {LLMs} when completing the task. Although generalization to other, less {LLM}-friendly tasks is unclear, our results call for platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human, perhaps using the methodology proposed here as a stepping stone.

We show that both types of predictor variables can be analyzed within the {LMEM} framework. We discuss designs with multiple sources of nonindependence, for example, studies in which the same subjects rate the same set of items or in which students nested in classrooms provide multiple answers. We provide clear guidelines about the types of random effects that should be included in the analysis of such designs. We also present a number of corrective steps that researchers can take when convergence fails in {LMEM} models with too many parameters.

Despite this, no evaluations have shown that {LLM} systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert {NLP} researchers and an {LLM} ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 {NLP} researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both {LLM} and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current {LLM} capabilities for research ideation: we find {LLM}-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p {\textless} 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of {LLM} self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome.},

Across groups, {NERs}, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. {EEG} revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and {LLM} users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, {LLM}-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-{LLM} users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the {LLM} group and the highest in the Brain-only group. {LLM} users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While {LLMs} offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, {LLM} users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels.

Drawing on theories of psychological contrast, we hypothesize that high intrinsic motivation in one task reduces performance on less intrinsically motivating tasks. In a field study at a Korean department store, employees with the highest maximum intrinsic motivation in one task had lower average and minimum performance across their other tasks as well as more performance variance across their tasks. In a laboratory experiment in the United States, working on a highly intrinsically motivating initial task led participants to perform worse in a subsequent task if it was uninteresting, but not if it was interesting. This effect was mediated by boredom, but not by a range of other psychological processes. Across both studies, moderate intrinsic motivation in one task was associated with better performance in less interesting tasks than high intrinsic motivation, revealing a curvilinear cross-task effect of intrinsic motivation. Our research advances knowledge about the dark side of intrinsic motivation, the design of work, and the drivers of task performance.},

Irrespective of the pace, watching the videos which presented unrealistic stories improved children’s response inhibition. For attention, there was an interaction between pace and realism. Exposure to the fast-paced video resulted in faster responding, but only when the story was realistic. Together the results suggest that a story’s realism, rather than the video’s pace, affects the inhibitory component of children’s executive function; whereas both pace and realism interact to affect attention.

The goal of this research was to study whether a fast-paced television show immediately influences preschool-aged children's executive function (eg, self-regulation, working memory).

{METHODS}:
Sixty 4-year-olds were randomly assigned to watch a fast-paced television cartoon or an educational cartoon or draw for 9 minutes. They were then given 4 tasks tapping executive function, including the classic delay-of-gratification and Tower of Hanoi tasks. Parents completed surveys regarding television viewing and child's attention.

{RESULTS}:
Children who watched the fast-paced television cartoon performed significantly worse on the executive function tasks than children in the other 2 groups when controlling for child attention, age, and television exposure.

{CONCLUSIONS}:
Just 9 minutes of viewing a fast-paced television cartoon had immediate negative effects on 4-year-olds' executive function. Parents should be aware that fast-paced television shows could at least temporarily impair young children's executive function.},

However, tablets may also reduce shared engagement as the action of viewing or touching the screen is often not visible to nearby adults. This may impact communicative gazing and pointing, which is critical to the formation of shared awareness and in turn supports language development.To assess the association of tablet media content with toddlers’ responses to joint attention prompts and behavioral requests.This cohort study took place at a behavioral research laboratory and included toddlers who were aged 18 to 32 months with neurotypical development who were recruited from a volunteer and community sample. Toddlers engaged with a real toy or 3 different types of tablet content (ie, viewing video of toy play, playing with a digital toy, or playing a commercial game) while an experimenter delivered joint attention prompts. Data were acquired from June 2021 November {XX} 2022, and data analysis occurred from January 2023 to May 2024.Main outcomes included child response to joint attention (number of prompts with joint attention response per number of prompts delivered) and child response to behavioral request (ie, the prompt on which the child responded to the behavioral request). Measures included crossed random effects, Wald tests, and likelihood ratio tests.In this study, 63 toddlers were enrolled, and data from 62 were included (31 female [49\%]; mean [{SD}] age, 26.1 [3.4] months; median [{IQR}] age, 25.0 [18.6-32.6] months). When toddlers were playing a commercial game on a tablet, they responded to fewer joint attention prompts (crossed random effects model, −0.15; 95\% {CI}, −0.24 to −0.06 prompts) and male toddlers took longer to acknowledge a behavioral request (interaction of content and sex, −0.75; 95\% {CI}, −1.36 to −0.17). The negative impact of the tablet game was larger as child age increased (τ = −2.30; 95\% {CI}, −0.05 to 0; P = .03). Greater media use at home was associated with decreased responding to joint attention prompts during the tablet game (ρ = −0.47; P \&lt; .001), while better language skills were associated with more joint attention during play with a real toy (ρ = 0.31; P = .02).In this cohort study, a touch-screen tablet game was associated with decreased joint attention among toddlers and they were less likely to respond to a behavioral request. In a laboratory setting, it was difficult for toddlers to engage in social-communicative interactions with adults when using a tablet media device.},

It is unknown which types of everyday activities promote the best language environment for children.To investigate whether the type of toy used during play is associated with the parent-infant communicative interaction.Controlled experiment in a natural environment of parent-infant communication during play with 3 different toy sets. Participant recruitment and data collection were conducted between February 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014. The volunteer sample included 26 parent-infant (aged 10-16 months) dyads.Fifteen-minute in-home parent-infant play sessions with electronic toys, traditional toys, and books.Numbers of adult words, child vocalizations, conversational turns, parent verbal responses to child utterances, and words produced by parents in 3 different semantic categories (content-specific words) per minute during play sessions.Among the 26 parent-infant dyads, toy type was associated with all outcome measures. During play with electronic toys, there were fewer adult words (mean, 39.62; 95\% {CI}, 33.36-45.65), fewer conversational turns (mean, 1.64; 95\% {CI}, 1.12-2.19), fewer parental responses (mean, 1.31; 95\% {CI}, 0.87-1.77), and fewer productions of content-specific words (mean, 1.89; 95\% {CI}, 1.49-2.35) than during play with traditional toys or books. Children vocalized less during play with electronic toys (mean per minute, 2.9; 95\% {CI}, 2.16-3.69) than during play with books (mean per minute, 3.91; 95\% {CI}, 3.09-4.68). Parents produced fewer words during play with traditional toys (mean per minute, 55.56; 95\% {CI}, 46.49-64.17) than during play with books (mean per minute, 66.89; 95\% {CI}, 59.93-74.19) and use of content-specific words was lower during play with traditional toys (mean per minute, 4.09; 95\% {CI}, 3.26-4.99) than during play with books (mean per minute, 6.96; 95\% {CI}, 6.07-7.97).Play with electronic toys is associated with decreased quantity and quality of language input compared with play with books or traditional toys. To promote early language development, play with electronic toys should be discouraged. Traditional toys may be a valuable alternative for parent-infant play time if book reading is not a preferred activity.},

We evaluated whether these findings applied to video chat by testing whether children aged 12-25 months could form relationships with and learn from on-screen partners. We manipulated social contingency: children experienced either real-time {FaceTime} conversations or pre-recorded Videos as the partner taught novel words, actions and patterns. Children were attentive and responsive in both conditions, but only children in the {FaceTime} group responded to the partner in a temporally synced manner. After one week, children in the {FaceTime} condition (but not the Video condition) preferred and recognized their Partner, learned more novel patterns, and the oldest children learned more novel words. Results extend previous studies to demonstrate that children under 2 years show social and cognitive learning from video chat because it retains social contingency.

	abstract = {Social cues are one way young children determine that a situation is pedagogical in nature -- containing information to be learned and generalized. However, some social cues (e.g., contingent gaze and responsiveness) are missing from pre-recorded video, a potential reason why toddlers’ language learning from video can be inefficient compared to their learning directly from a person. This study explored two methods for supporting children’s word learning from video by adding social-communicative cues. Eighty-eight 30-month-olds began their participation with a video training phase. In one manipulation, an on-screen actress responded contingently to children through a live video feed (similar to Skype or {FaceTime} “video chat”) or appeared in a pre-recorded demonstration. In the other manipulation, parents either modeled responsiveness to the actress’ on-screen bids for participation or sat out of their child’s view. Children then viewed a labeling demonstration on video, and their knowledge of the label was tested with 3D objects. Results indicated that both on-screen contingency and parent modeling increased children’s engagement with the actress during training. However, only parent modeling increased children’s subsequent word learning, perhaps by revealing the symbolic (representational) intentions underlying this video. This study highlights the importance of adult co-viewing in helping toddlers interpret communicative cues from video.},

	abstract = {People generally evaluate music less favourably if they believe it is created by artificial intelligence ({AI}) rather than humans. But the psychological mechanisms underlying this tendency remain unclear. Prior research has relied entirely on self-reports that are vulnerable to bias. This leaves open the question as to whether negative reactions are a reflection of motivated reasoning – a controlled, cognitive process in which people justify their scepticism about {AI}'s creative capacity – or whether they stem from deeper, embodied feelings of threat to human creative uniqueness manifested physiologically. We address this question across two lab-in-field studies, measuring participants' self-reported and physiological responses to the same piece of music framed either as having {AI} or human origins. Study 1 (N = 50) revealed that individuals in the {AI} condition appreciated music less, reported less intense emotions, and experienced decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity as compared to those in the human condition. Study 2 (N = 372) showed that these effects were more pronounced among individuals who more strongly endorsed the belief that creativity is uniquely human, and that this could largely be explained by the perceived threat posed by {AI}. Together, these findings suggest that unfavourable responses to {AI}-generated music are not driven solely by controlled cognitive justifications but also by automatic, embodied threat reactions in response to creative {AI}. They suggest that strategies addressing perceived threats posed by {AI} may be key to fostering more harmonious human-{AI} collaboration and acceptance.},

In a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair, the {AIM} and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of {AIM} songs from real-world usage of commercial models (i.e., Suno).

This study investigated listeners' emotions, perceptions, and attitudes toward {AI}-generated versus human-composed pop music. The study hypothesized that listeners would rate music labelled as {AI}-generated lower in terms of liking, quality, positive emotions, sensorial, imaginal, and experiential responses, as well as need for re-experience and purchase intention, compared to music labelled as human-composed. Participants listened to eight {AI}-generated pop songs, four labelled as {AI}-generated and four labelled as human-composed. They then rated each song on various dimensions. To ensure a balanced design, label assignment on composer identity was fully randomized across both participants and songs. Contrary to the hypotheses, the participants rated pop songs labelled as {AI}-generated more highly in positive emotions, including happiness, interest, awe, and energy, compared to those labelled as human-composed. No significant differences were found between purported composer identity in the remaining dimensions. These results suggest that while the perception of {AI} authorship does influence listeners, the effects are primarily affective rather than sensorial, imaginal, experiential, or behavioural. Notably, considering that listeners rated pop songs labelled as {AI}-generated more positively in emotions, the findings imply that {AI}-generated music may be more readily accepted than previously assumed.},

Recently, a study proposed the existence of an {AI} composer bias; namely, listeners tend to like music less when they think (or are told) that it was composed by an {AI}. In this online study (N = 120), we used a cross-over experimental design to verify whether such bias extends to audiovisual music performance. The participants rated three videos of classic piano music performances in two versions with identical audio: one with a professional pianist who pretended to play, and one with the piano playing automatically, allegedly thanks to an {AI}. As hypothesised, the participants rated the performances as more likeable, engaging, higher in emotional valence, and of higher quality when the pieces were “performed” by the pianist. Notably, these effects were insensitive to the participants’ musical expertise but moderated by their attitudes toward {AI}. Interestingly, when asked what differences they had found between the two renditions, the participants confabulated about differences in rhythm, tempo variations, dynamics, and dissonances, pointing to underlying psychological processes, such as expectations and beliefs about humanness. Implications for Aesthetics and the Psychology of Art are discussed.},

	abstract = {Numerous powerful large language models ({LLMs}) are now available for use as writing support tools, idea generators, and beyond. Although these {LLMs} are marketed as helpful creative assistants, several works have shown that using an {LLM} as a creative partner results in a narrower set of creative outputs. However, these studies only consider the effects of interacting with a single {LLM}, begging the question of whether such narrowed creativity stems from using a particular {LLM} -- which arguably has a limited range of outputs -- or from using {LLMs} in general as creative assistants. To study this question, we elicit creative responses from humans and a broad set of {LLMs} using standardized creativity tests and compare the population-level diversity of responses. We find that {LLM} responses are much more similar to other {LLM} responses than human responses are to each other, even after controlling for response structure and other key variables. This finding of significant homogeneity in creative outputs across the {LLMs} we evaluate adds a new dimension to the ongoing conversation about creativity and {LLMs}. If today's {LLMs} behave similarly, using them as a creative partners -- regardless of the model used -- may drive all users towards a limited set of "creative" outputs.},

While their task performance improved by three points compared to a norm population, participants overestimated their task performance by four points. Interestingly, higher {AI} literacy correlated with lower metacognitive accuracy, suggesting that those with more technical knowledge of {AI} were more confident but less precise in judging their own performance. Using a computational model, we explored individual differences in metacognitive accuracy and found that the Dunning–Kruger effect, usually observed in this task, ceased to exist with {AI} use. Study 2 (N = 452) replicates these findings. We discuss how {AI} levels cognitive and metacognitive performance in human–{AI} interaction and consider the consequences of performance overestimation for designing interactive {AI} systems that foster accurate self-monitoring, avoid overreliance, and enhance cognitive performance.},

	abstract = {As {US} Internet penetration rates have climbed, digital divide researchers have largely shifted attention to differences in Internet skills. Interviews with 72 low-income {US} residents from both a large metropolitan city and a medium-sized Midwestern town, however, reveal that many people still struggle to maintain physical access, supporting technology maintenance theory. Technology maintenance theory argues that although most of the {US} poor now use digital technology, access is unstable and characterized by frequent periods of disconnection. As a result, low-income users must work to maintain access, often experiencing cycles of dependable instability. In these interviews, nearly all used the Internet, but technology maintenance practices were widespread, including negotiation of temporarily disconnected service, broken hardware, and logistic limitations on public access. As a result, participants had limited access to health information and employment, and biased attitudes toward technology. That is, in some cases, negative attitudes toward Internet adoption reflected a rational response to disconnection rather than cultural norms or fears of the Internet, as suggested by previous research. Findings support and extend the theory of technology maintenance by emphasizing a shift in the {US} digital divide from issues of ownership to issues of sustainability; they also provide insight into the interrelated nature of access and attitudes toward technology. This new theoretical approach complements other theoretical approaches to the digital divide that foreground a contextualized understanding of digital disparities as embedded within a history of broad social disparities.},

	abstract = {Generative {AI} systems, especially Large Language Models ({LLMs}) such as {ChatGPT}, have recently emerged as significant contributors to creative processes. While {LLMs} can produce creative content that might be as good as or even better than human-created content, their widespread use risks reducing creative diversity across groups of people. In the present research, we aimed to quantify this homogenizing effect of {LLMs} on creative diversity, not only at the individual level but also at the collective level. Across three preregistered studies, we analyzed 2,200 college admissions essays. Using a novel measure—the diversity growth rate—we showed that each additional human-written essay contributed more new ideas than did each additional {GPT}-4 essay. Notably, this difference became more pronounced as more essays were included in the analysis and persisted despite efforts to enhance {AI}-generated content through both prompt and parameter modifications. Overall, our findings suggest that, despite their potential to enhance individual creativity, the widespread use of {LLMs} could diminish the collective diversity of creative ideas.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study examined how specific attributes of algorithmic decision-making tools ({ADTs}), related to algorithm design and institutional governance, affect the public’s perceptions of implementing {ADTs} in government programs. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that acceptability varies systematically by policy domain. Regarding algorithm design, we predicted that higher accuracy, transparency, and government in-house development will enhance acceptability. Institutional features were also expected to shape perceptions: Explanations, stakeholder engagement, oversight mechanisms, and human involvement are anticipated to increase public perceptions. Method: This study employed a conjoint experimental design with 1,213 U.S. adults. Participants evaluated five policy proposals, each featuring a proposal to implement an {ADT}. Each proposal included randomly generated attributes across nine dimensions. Participants decided on the {ADT}’s acceptability, fairness, and efficiency for each proposal. The analysis focused on the average marginal component effects of {ADT} attributes. Results: A combination of attributes related to process individualization significantly enhanced the perceived acceptability of the use of algorithms by government. Participants preferred {ADTs} that elevate the agency of the stakeholder (decision explanations, hearing options, notices, and human involvement in the decision-making process). The policy domain mattered most for fairness and acceptability, whereas accuracy mattered most for efficiency perceptions. Conclusion: Explaining decisions made using an algorithm, giving appropriate notice, providing a hearing option, and maintaining the supervision of a human agent are key components for public support when algorithmic systems are being implemented.

Given that such autonomous systems can cause severe harm to individuals and social groups, fairness concerns have arisen. A human-centric approach demanded by scholars and policymakers requires considering people's fairness perceptions when designing and implementing algorithmic decision-making. We provide a comprehensive, systematic literature review synthesizing the existing empirical insights on perceptions of algorithmic fairness from 58 empirical studies spanning multiple domains and scientific disciplines. Through thorough coding, we systemize the current empirical literature along four dimensions: (1) algorithmic predictors, (2) human predictors, (3) comparative effects (human decision-making vs. algorithmic decision-making), and (4) consequences of algorithmic decision-making. While we identify much heterogeneity around the theoretical concepts and empirical measurements of algorithmic fairness, the insights come almost exclusively from Western-democratic contexts. By advocating for more interdisciplinary research adopting a society-in-the-loop framework, we hope our work will contribute to fairer and more responsible algorithmic decision-making.},

	abstract = {Developments in artificial intelligence ({AI}) have accelerated scientific discovery1. Alongside recent {AI}-oriented Nobel prizes2–9, these trends establish the role of {AI} tools in science10. This advancement raises questions about the influence of {AI} tools on scientists and science as a whole, and highlights a potential conflict between individual and collective benefits11. To evaluate these questions, we used a pretrained language model to identify {AI}-augmented research, with an F1-score of 0.875 in validation against expert-labelled data. Using a dataset of 41.3 million research papers across the natural sciences and covering distinct eras of {AI}, here we show an accelerated adoption of {AI} tools among scientists and consistent professional advantages associated with {AI} usage, but a collective narrowing of scientific focus. Scientists who engage in {AI}-augmented research publish 3.02 times more papers, receive 4.84 times more citations and become research project leaders 1.37 years earlier than those who do not. By contrast, {AI} adoption shrinks the collective volume of scientific topics studied by 4.63\% and decreases scientists’ engagement with one another by 22\%. By consequence, adoption of {AI} in science presents what seems to be a paradox: an expansion of individual scientists’ impact but a contraction in collective science’s reach, as {AI}-augmented work moves collectively towards areas richest in data. With reduced follow-on engagement, {AI} tools seem to automate established fields rather than explore new ones, highlighting a tension between personal advancement and collective scientific progress.},
